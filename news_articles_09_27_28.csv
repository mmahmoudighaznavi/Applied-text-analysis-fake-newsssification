"Trump and ‘MAGA Re­pub­li­can ex­trem­ists’ threat­en US democ­ra­cy, Biden says",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/trump-and-maga-republican-extremists-threaten-us-democracy-biden-says,"Biden has un­der­scored the risk to democ­ra­cy in a speech ded­i­cat­ed to his late Re­pub­li­can coun­ter­part, John Mc­Cain.","United States President Joe Biden has lashed out at his Republican rival Donald Trump, saying the former president’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) following is an “extremist movement that does not share the basic beliefs in our democracy”. During an event to honour late Senator John McCain in Tempe, Arizona, on Thursday, Biden said that, while not all Republicans adhere to the movement, the party is currently “driven and intimidated by MAGA Republican extremists”. “Their extreme agenda, if carried out, will fundamentally alter the institutions of American democracy as we know it,” he said. Biden has made protecting democracy and state institutions a key plank in his 2024 re-election bid as the country’s election race picks up steam. In doing so, the Democratic president hopes to strike a contrast with Trump, his Republican predecessor. During his speech, Biden made scarce mention of Trump, who is currently the clear frontrunner for the Republican Party’s 2024 nomination. But Trump loomed large throughout the remarks, and Biden referenced Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, both directly and indirectly. “Democracy means rule of the people. Not rule of monarchs, not rule of the money, not rule of the mighty,” Biden told the audience at the Tempe Center for the Arts. “Regardless of party, that means respecting free and fair elections. Accepting the outcome, win or lose.” Trump has long maintained, without evidence, that the 2020 election was “stolen” from him through voter fraud. He currently faces four criminal indictments, two of which pertain to his efforts to reverse his 2020 loss to Biden. Trump has denied wrongdoing in all four cases. Biden also alluded to the rising political violence in the country, a phenomenon that has come to be typified by the deadly attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. During that attack, thousands of Trump supporters converged on the Capitol, attacking law enforcement and breaking into the building in an attempt to halt the certification of 2020 election results. An estimated1,146participants have been arrested in the years since, with 657 pleading guilty to federal charges.  Trump has been criticised for inaction during the January 6 attack, ignoring calls to intervene. Eventually, after hours of violence, he released a Twitter video calling for the rioters to leave the Capitol, though he reiterated his false claim of election fraud. “Go home. We love you. You’re very special,” Trump told the rioters in the video. “I know how you feel.” Biden appeared to take aim at those kinds of remarks in Thursday’s address. “Democracy means rejecting and repudiating political violence. Regardless of party, such violence is never, never, never acceptable in America. It’s undemocratic, and it must never be normalised to advance political power,” he said. Biden also accused Trump and his allies of leading with “vengeance and vindictiveness”, stretching the bounds of the US Constitution to further political aims. He said “extremists” in the Republican Party are “pushing a notion the defeated former president expressed when he was in office”.  That notion, Biden continued, is that the president “is above the law, no limits on power”. “Trump says the constitution gave him, quote, the right to do whatever he wants as president, end of quote,” Biden continued. “I’ve never heard a president say that in jest.”  As the Republican Party lurches rightward, Biden made an appeal to the political centre with his speech, playing up his across-the-aisle friendship with the late McCain, a Vietnam War veteran and Republican. “We’re like two brothers. We’d argue like hell,” Biden said, reprising a theme he has spoken to in the past. “I mean, really go at each other. And then we’d go to lunch together.” Trump has previously issued controversial remarks about McCain, questioning whether the late senator could be a “hero” if he was a prisoner of war: “I like people who weren’t captured, okay?” Arizona, formerly a Republican stronghold, has increasingly become a key swing state. In 2016, Trump won Arizona. In 2020, Biden did, turning the state blue for the first time since the 1990s. Al Jazeera’s John Hendren said that Arizona will be crucial in the likely rematch between Biden and Trump in 2024. “There are three states that most analysts say the Republicans have to win,” Hendren explained from Tempe. “They say the Republicans have to win Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona.” Hendren also highlighted the fact that Biden’s speech takes place against the ongoing debate over federal spending — and a fast-approaching September 30 deadline to pass budget legislation. If Congress fails to pass a budget bill, all non-essential government functions are slated to shut down, with federal programmes and employee paychecks suspended. “As he spoke, the government faces a looming shutdown led by MAGA extremists in the Republican Party,” Hendren explained. Biden, he added, was asking the nation, “What do we want to be?” “You can see this is a shot across the bow of Donald Trump, and it is the clarion call of Biden’s campaign in the coming year,” Hendren said."
East Libya com­man­der Haf­tar in Moscow for talks with Putin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/east-libya-commander-haftar-in-moscow-for-talks-with-putin,"Krem­lin spokesper­son con­firms meet­ing, say­ing the two men dis­cussed the sit­u­a­tion in Libya and wider re­gion.","Renegade general Khalifa Haftar, whose forces dominate eastern Libya, has held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, his forces and the Kremlin said. Haftar, who sponsors a rival administration to Libya’s UN-backed government in Tripoli, has long cultivated close relations with Moscow and relies heavily onRussian mercenary group Wagnerfor military support. Haftar “held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu”, his Libyan Arab Armed Forces said on its official Facebook page without giving further details. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed Haftar’s meeting with Putin. “They discussed the situation in Libya and the region as a whole,” he said in comments reported by Russia’s state news agency TASS. It was the first meeting between the two men since 2019, according to Libyan media. The eastern strongman, who arrived in Moscow on Tuesday, had already held talks with Russian Deputy Defence Minister Yunus-Bek Yevkurov during his visit. Yevkurov has been a regular visitor to eastern Libya in recent years, most recently on September 17 when he met Haftar a few days after thehuge flash floodwhich swept away much of the coastal city of Derna, killing thousands of people and leaving thousands more missing. Haftar’s abortive 2019 assault on the seat of the UN-backed government in Tripoli relied heavily on Wagner mercenaries but failed to overcome its Turkish-backed armed forces. Since an October 2020 ceasefire brought the offensive to an end, Wagner has redeployed some of its personnel to Mali and Ukraine. But despite repeated United Nations Security Council resolutions calling for the withdrawal of all foreign military forces from Libya, hundreds of Wagner personnel remain stationed in the east as well as in areas of the desert south under Haftar’s control. Russia has long sought to boost its influence in Africa, a policy that has loomed ever larger since the launch of its war on Ukraine early last year left it saddled with European Union and United States sanctions and increasingly isolated on the international stage.

"Be­larus says Pol­ish he­li­copter vi­o­lat­ed air­space, War­saw de­nies",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/belarus-says-polish-helicopter-violated-airspace-warsaw-denies,Be­larus has re­peat­ed­ly ac­cused the EU mem­ber of breach­ing its air­space. War­saw de­nies the claims.,"Belarus has claimed that a Polish helicopter had violated its airspace as tensions are high between the two countries amid the conflict in Ukraine. “Around 1520 (1220 GMT), the aircraft crossed the border of the Republic of Belarus, flew to a depth of up to 1.5 km. At 1622, the helicopter repeatedly violated the state border, going 300 metres deep,” the Ministry of Defence of Belarus said on Thursday on its Telegram channel. Belarus,Russia’s closest ally, said it had scrambled military aircraft in response. The Polish army said the Belarusian claim was “false”. “Records made by flight control stations and radar stations confirm: such an event did not take place,” the army’s operational command said in a statement. “The Polish army respects and follows all provisions and regulations relating to the inviolability of borders.” Belarus has repeatedly accused the EU member of breaching its airspace. Warsaw has denied the claims. Belarus’s foreign ministry said it had summoned the Polish charge d’affaires, Marcin Wojciechowski, to protest. According to the ministry, Minsk has demanded Warsaw conduct “an objective investigation into the incident” and take measures to prevent such incidents in the future. Last week, the Kremlin said that Moscow and its ally Belarus were “watching” Poland closely, calling it a “rather aggressive” country."

Blinken meet­ing In­di­an coun­ter­part amid fall­out over Sikh leader’s killing,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/blinken-meeting-indian-counterpart-amid-fallout-over-sikh-leaders-killing,Cana­da PM says he re­ceived as­sur­ances that US will raise Hard­eep Singh Ni­j­jar’s killing with In­di­an for­eign min­is­ter.,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is meeting with his Indian counterpart in Washington, DC, as the United States has urged India to cooperate withCanada’s investigationinto the killing of a prominent Sikh Canadian leader. At the start of talks with Blinken on Thursday afternoon, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said it was “good to be back” in the US capital and thanked Washington for its support at the recent G20summitin New Delhi. Jaishankar also met US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan earlier in the day, writing on social media that the pair “recognized the tremendous progress in our bilateral relationship this year and discussed taking it forward”. But Jaishankar’s trip comes as India faces growing international scrutiny after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeausaid last weekthat Ottawa was investigating “credible allegations of a potential link” between India and the killing of Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. On Thursday, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller declined to preview the meeting between Blinken and Jaishankar, but said Washington has urged New Delhi to cooperate with the probe. Miller added that those efforts will continue. However, Trudeau told reporters on Thursday afternoon that he had received assurances from US officials that Blinken will raisethe Canadian allegationswith Jaishankar. “The Americans have been with us in speaking to the Indian government about how important it is that they be involved in following up on the credible allegations that agents of the Indian government killed a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil,” the prime minister said.  Nijjar, who wasfatally shotoutside a Sikh temple in the province of British Columbia in June, was a vocal supporter of a Sikh separatist movement in India and had been previously labelled a “terrorist” by New Delhi. Blinken has previously said the administration of US President Joe Biden is “deeply concerned” by Canada’s allegations, and that Washington is coordinating with Ottawa on the issue. Last week, the US secretary of state also said it was “critical that the Canadian investigation proceed, and it would be important that India work with the Canadians”. India has roundly rejected the accusations it was involved in Nijjar’s killing as “absurd” and politically motivated. New Delhi also has accused Ottawa of harbouring Sikh “terrorists and extremists”. Indian officials have long framed the decades-long Sikh separatist movement, known as theKhalistan movement, as a pressing threat to national security. Most recently, Jaishankar, whenasked about the allegationsat a Council on Foreign Relations event in New York on Tuesday, said India had told Canada it would look into any “specific” details it provides on the killing of Nijjar. Miller at the US State Department also told reporters on Wednesday that Blinken did not raise the issue with Jaishankar during a meeting of the Quad grouping – which includes the US, India, Australia and Japan – in New York last week. Canada’s allegations have left the US in an uncomfortable position as it seeks to court India amid a wider effort to counter China’s growing influence in the Asia-Pacific region. Biden welcomedIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the White House for an official state visit in June, despite condemnation from rights observers over the Indian government’s treatment of minorities and the erosion of democratic norms in the country. On Thursday, Trudeau also referenced India’s rising global influence and said the US and other Western allies should continue to engage with New Delhi.  “India is a growing economic power and important geopolitical player, and as we’ve presented with our Indo-Pacific strategy just last year, we’re very serious about building closer ties with India,” he said. “At the same time, obviously, as a rule of law country, we need to emphasise that India needs to work with Canada to ensure that we get the full facts of this matter,” added Trudeau, referring to Nijjar’s killing. Further complicating the US-India relationship have been reports that Washington worked closely with Ottawa on the intelligence that informed Trudeau’s allegations of a possible link between the killing and Indian government agents. The Financial Times also reported that Biden had raised concerns about the matter during a meeting with Modi at the G20 Summit in New Delhi in early September. Meanwhile, Sikh American community leader Pritpal Singh,in a letterto US legislators on the American Sikh Congressional Caucus last week, highlighted what he called “growing evidence of India’s transnational repression against Sikh Americans”. Singh also recently told The Intercept news website that he had been personally notified by the FBI of a credible threat on his life. In his letter, he called on US legislators to launch an investigation into threats received by Sikh activists and to express deep concern to the Indian government. US Representative Eric Swalwell, a member of the American Sikh Congressional Caucus, said on Monday that he was “concerned by reports that India’s government is targeting Sikh activists abroad”. “I will work with local & federal government officials to ensure necessary actions are undertaken to protect the Sikh community,” Swalwell wrote on social media.

US Visa Waiv­er Pro­gram: Why Arab Amer­i­cans an­gered by Is­rael’s ad­mis­sion,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/us-visa-waiver-program-why-arab-americans-angered-by-israels-admission,Ad­vo­cates say US gov­ern­ment is turn­ing blind eye to vi­o­la­tions against its own cit­i­zens’ rights to give perk to Is­rael.,"Washington, DC –The Biden administration’s decision to allow Israelis totravel visa-freeto the United States has drawn the ire of Arab Americans who say the move represents tacit approval of Israeli discrimination against US Palestinian and Arab travellers. The US admitted Israel on Wednesday into the selective Visa Waiver Program (VWP), hailing the relationship between the two top allies. The VWP requires admitted nations to abide by what’s known as “reciprocity”. This means that countries whose nationals are allowed to travel to the US without visas must, in turn, not discriminate or deny entry to American citizens without credible cause. In this case, however, Palestinian rights supporters say the US will allow Israel’s citizens to enter the country without a visa while the Israeli governmentdetains, questionsand turns back American travellers. Activists argued that by adding Israel to the VWP, the US was overlooking well-documented Israeli discrimination against Americans of Arab and Palestinian descent, as well as supporters of Palestinian human rights more broadly. For example, Israeldid not allowUS Congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib to visit the country and the occupied Palestinian territories in 2019, citing “their boycott activities against Israel”. James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, a Washington, DC-based think tank, said the US is deprioritising the rights of its own citizens. “This was about us. It was about Arab Americans and our rights,” said Zogby. “I feel betrayed by my government because they knowingly threw us under the bus.”  US officials have often stressed that “blue is blue”, referring to the colour of the American passport and the privileges it entails. Reciprocity is a key element of US travel policies; Washington even imposes visa fees on citizens of countries that charge American citizens for visas. In a statement on Wednesday, Washington said Israel had met the reciprocity requirement. “Israel made updates to its entry policies to meet the VWP requirement to extend reciprocal privileges to all US citizens without regard to national origin, religion, or ethnicity,” US government agencies said. But activists say Israel was handed the perks of the VWP in disregard of its mistreatment of American citizens and in violation of US laws. For example, Americans residing in Gaza will still need a special permit from the Israeli authorities to leave the besieged territory – an arrangement that does not exist for any other country in the programme. Pressed on the issue on Wednesday, Department of State spokespersonMatthew Milleracknowledged that there “are different procedures” for Gaza, saying that the territory is controlled by a “foreign terrorist organisation”, referring to the Palestinian movement Hamas. But he insisted that Israel still meets the reciprocity requirement. Further angering many Arab Americans is the fact that Biden administration officials did not merely accept Israel into the programme. They actively and publicly pushed for its inclusion in a campaign largely led by Thomas Nides, Washington’s former envoy to Israel, who frequently posted about the effort onsocial mediaover the past two years. Moreover, activists said that the VWP inclusion handed a political victory to one of the most right-wing governments in Israeli history under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Zogby said US President Joe Biden’s pushto heap rewardson Israel is difficult to understand. “I’m insulted, and I’m angry,” he added. He told Al Jazeera that he has himself been held and questioned for hours at Israeli checkpoints, even when accompanying American officials in the region.  “They have no respect for us,” Zogby said of Israel. “And now our own government says in effect they don’t respect us. That’s the problem.” Israel’s entry into the VWP also came amid growing concerns about the safety of US citizens in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories and themuted responsefrom Washington to abuses against them. Israeli forces killed two US citizens last year: renowned Al Jazeera journalistShireen Abu Aklehand an elderly Palestinian-American man,Omar Assad. Here’s how other Arab Americans, Palestinian rights advocates and US lawmakers responded to the decision to add Israel to the VWP this week: “This decision enables further racist practices and violence towards Americans including the murder ofShireen Abu Akleh. The United States has yet to hold the Israeli government accountable. “The Visa Waiver Program requires that all US citizens are treated equally. I have received consistent reports of discrimination of Americans attempting to enter Israel.” “The Biden Administration’s designation of Israel to be admitted into the Visa Waiver Program is a heinous lapse of oversight that relegates US law below Israeli law and exchanges the rights of US citizens for closer ties with an apartheid state that arms authoritarian governments abroad.” “By admitting Israel to the Visa Waiver Program, the United States is essentially condoning Israel’s apartheid regime over Palestinians by signing off on Israel’s discrimination against Palestinian American citizens.” “Separate can never be equal, as was determined decades ago in the fightfor civil rightsin this country. “Forty countries participate in the VWP, and none have formal arrangements to discriminate against American citizens; only Israel has demanded and been granted this unconscionable favor by the US government.”  “To date, Israel has failed to meet the ‘Blue is Blue’ requirement. “Adherence to this important American tenet of reciprocity and equal treatment of all US citizens is critical to the integrity of the Visa Waiver Program, and we are deeply concerned with the Administration’s decision to move forward in violation of that principle.” “Once again, the US is singling out Israel for special and exceptionalized treatment at the expense of the rights of Palestinian Americans.” “Israel’s discrimination is especially egregious against Palestinian Americans with ties to Gaza, making reunification of families torn apart by Israel’s siege and blockade of Gaza near impossible.Apartheid isnot only Israeli policy, it is US policy too.”"
"Chi­na Ever­grande’s founder un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion, shares halt­ed",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/9/28/china-evergrandes-founder-under-investigation-shares-halted,World’s most in­debt­ed prop­er­ty de­vel­op­er did not say what were the ‘il­le­gal crimes’ for which he was be­ing in­ves­ti­gat­ed.,"China Evergrande Group’s founder is being investigated over suspected “illegal crimes”, the embattled developer said on Thursday, as creditors become increasingly concerned about the group’s prospects amid an uncertain debt revamp plan and liquidation risk. The world’s most indebted property developerwith more than $300bn in total liabilities did not say whether Hui Ka Yan was still in a position to run the company, or what crimes he is being investigated for. Trading in shares of the company was suspended earlier in the day after a report that its chairman had been placed under police watch. Evergrande said the shares will remain suspended until further notice. “The Company hereby announces that the Company has received notification from relevant authorities that Mr. Hui Ka Yan … has been subject to mandatory measures in accordance with the law due to suspicion of illegal crimes,” Evergrande said. The news signalled for the first time that authorities could hold the billionaire Evergrande founder accountable for the developer’s financialwoes, which have ripped through the property sectorthat accounts for roughly a quarter of the Chinese economy. Deepening turmoil in China’s debt-laden property sector is threatening to undermine Beijing’s efforts to get the sputtering economy back on more solid footing, and raising fears among investors of a spillover into the country’s banking system. The latest development is a major blow to China’s once top-selling developer that has lurched from one crisis to another since its cash squeeze became public in 2021 and it defaulted on its offshore debt obligations later that year. “It is unclear why Hui is under police surveillance, but it may signal certain negotiations demanded from the government. The latest development has disrupted the hope of restructuring,” said Gary Ng, Asia Pacific senior economist at Natixis. “No developer is too big to fail in China, and therefore it is hard to imagine a full bailout. Still, when it comes to stability, it is possible to see more government influence in different ways,” Ng added. Evergrande has been working to get creditors’ approval for restructuring its offshore debt. The process got complicated this week after Evergrande said it was unable to issue new debt due to an investigation into its main China unit. The offshore debt restructuring plan now looks set to falter and the risks of the company being liquidated are rising, some analysts said. Reuters reported on Tuesday that a major Evergrande offshore creditor group was planning to join a liquidation court petition filed against the developer if it does not submit a new debt revamp plan by the end of October. Evergrande’s problems have raised the prospect of an intervention by the Chinese authorities to manage any possible impact on the financial system and the broader economy, analysts said. “They’ve managed to avoid the ‘bottom line’ of preventing a systemic crisis caused by one of the developers so far, and will almost certainly intervene further if Evergrande’s situation appears likely to lead to contagion,” said Christopher Beddor, deputy director of China research at Gavekal Dragonomics. “But apart from that, their approach … has often seemed conflicted and at times incoherent, and that continues today.” Chinese media outlet Yicai, citing sources, said some other Evergrande executives were also being investigated. Evergrande did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment outside Asia business hours. The investigation into Hui, who founded Evergrande in 1996, is a remarkable fall from grace for the 64-year-old former steel technician, who just two years ago moved in power circles and exuded confidence about his business. “At least it shows that the recent series of turmoil in Evergrande is not groundless,” said Yan Yuejin, an analyst at the E-house China Research and Development Institution in Shanghai. “We believe that Evergrande’s debt turmoil has had a great turmoil and negative impact on the global economy, and the things behind it are not simple.” Evergrande’s latest woes come against the backdrop of Beijing rolling out a host of measures in the last few weeks, including cutting existing mortgage rates, to revive the battered property sector. On Thursday, the finance ministry said China would exempt urban land used for affordable housing projects from taxes, starting in October. Buyers of such housing, and housing management firms, will also be exempt from stamp duties, the ministry said. The recent regulatory easing may stabilize the housing market in the world’s second-largest economy to some extent, analysts said, however, the appetite for buying property remains subdued in the weak economy. “Still, the overhang of housing inventories in lower-tier cities facing population decline will persist for several years,” Saxo Greater China Market strategist Redmond Wong wrote in a research note. “This will lead to more headlines about defaults, restructuring, and liquidation of insolvent developers, causing losses for shareholders, bondholders, banks, and investors in trust and wealth management products tied to property projects.”"
Bankman-Fried may face ‘very long sen­tence’ if con­vict­ed: Judge,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/9/28/bankman-fried-may-face-very-long-sentence-if-convicted-judge,The judge’s com­ments came just be­fore he de­nied Bankman-Fried’s re­quest to be re­leased from jail to pre­pare for tri­al.,"Sam Bankman-Fried, the indicted founder of now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, may face a “very long sentence” if convicted at his fraud trial starting next week, the judge overseeing the case said on Thursday. United States District Judge Lewis Kaplan’s comments came just before he denied the 31-year-old former billionaire’s request to be released from jail temporarily during the trial to better help his lawyers mount his defense case. Kaplan said Bankman-Fried was a flight risk. “Your client in the event of conviction could be looking at a very long sentence,” Kaplan said in a hearing in Manhattan federal court. “If things begin to look bleak … maybe the time would come when he would seek to flee.” Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried’s lawyer, said there was “nothing in the record” to suggest that his client would try to flee. He said Bankman-Fried had voluntarily consented to extradition from the Bahamas – where FTX was based – to the US after his December 2022 arrest. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to seven counts of fraud and conspiracy stemming from FTX’s collapse in November 2022. He faces a statutory maximum of 110 years in prison, though any sentence would be determined by Kaplan based on a range of factors and he would likely get far less. His lawyers asked Kaplan for temporary release earlier this week, arguing they could not speak with him after each trial day to prepare for the next day’s witnesses and testimony, which they could not do if he were taken back to theMetropolitan Detention Centerin Brooklyn at the end of each trial day. Kaplan said on Thursday he was sympathetic to the defense’s concerns and would arrange for Bankman-Fried to arrive at court at 7am on most trial days to speak with his lawyers for several hours before testimony begins. Prosecutors say Bankman-Fried stole billions of dollars in FTX customer deposits to plug losses at Alameda Research, a crypto-focused hedge fund he controlled. They opposed Bankman-Fried’s request for temporary release. On Thursday, prosecutor Danielle Kudla told Kaplan that Bankman-Fried had “ample opportunity to prepare for trial” during the seven and a half months he was free on bail at his home in Palo Alto, California. Kaplan jailed him on August 11 after finding he likelytampered with witnessesat least twice – including by sharing former Alameda chief executive officer Caroline Ellison’s private writings with a New York Times reporter. Ellison, also Bankman-Fried’s former romantic partner, is one of three former members of his inner circle who have pleaded guilty to fraud and are set to testify against him. Former FTX executives Gary Wang and Nishad Singh have also agreed to testify. Kaplan said on Thursday that prosecutors had requested that he grant two additional witnesses immunity from being charged with crimes in exchange for their testimony. He did not identify those witnesses. The trial starts on October 3 and could last up to six weeks."
"Thai po­lice seize $8.15m worth metham­phet­a­mine pills, oth­er drugs",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/thai-police-seizes-8-15-million-worth-methamphetamine-pills-and-other-drug,Myan­mar also says it seized al­most half a tonne of crys­tal meth worth more than $4m.,"Thai police seized more than 15 million methamphetamine pills and other illegal substances worth 300 million baht ($8.15m) in what authorities said was one of the largest drug hauls so far this year. Four people were arrested on Thursday in connection with the bust, which included 420kg (926 pounds) of crystal methamphetamine, as well as heroin, at a home in Nakhon Pathom province, north of the capital Bangkok. “This is one of the largest drug storage facilities in the middle of Thailand, in a community area,” Justice Minister Tawee Sodsong told reporters. Incoming police chief General Torsak Sukvimol said the overall street value of the bust was 300 million baht, adding that the drugs were produced in a neighbouring country. Trafficking of synthetic drugs in East and Southeast Asia is surging, the United Nations said in a report earlier this year, with high volumes of methamphetamine still being produced from the Golden Triangle region where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand and Laos meet. The region has a long history of illicit drug production and has recently served as an enormous production centre for amphetamine-type stimulants, especially methamphetamine, used by Asian crime syndicates with distribution networks reaching as far as Japan and New Zealand. Also on Thursday, Myanmar authorities said they had seized almost half a tonne of crystal meth worth more than $4m. Security forces stopped a motorcycle and van in a forest in the northern Mandalay region during the early hours of Sunday, Myanmar’s Central Committee on Drug Abuse Control said in a statement. “The search brought the seizure of 435 kg of crystal meth (ICE) with a local value of 8.7 billion kyats” ($4.14m) the statement said. It said the drugs were being transported from Myanmar’s Shan state – Southeast Asia’s primary source of meth, according to the UN – and authorities were conducting further investigations. Analysts have said that the military, which removed an elected government and seized power in 2021, is not serious about ending the lucrative trade. Earlier this year, in a rare admission, the head of Myanmar’s CCDAC said its efforts to crush the multibillion-dollar tradewere having no impact. "
Stu­dent gun­man kills three in Rot­ter­dam uni­ver­si­ty shoot­ing,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/rotterdam-shootings-lead-to-multiple-deaths-arrest-dutch-police,"An un­known per­son wear­ing com­bat cloth­ing shot at peo­ple first in an apart­ment and af­ter in a hos­pi­tal, po­lice said.","Dutch police said a gunman killed a teacher, a local woman and her daughter after opening fire in a classroom at a university hospital campus in Rotterdam and a nearby house on Thursday. The 32-year-old suspect, a university student, fatally shot a 39-year-old woman living in his neighbourhood and seriously injured her 14-year-old daughter, police said in a televised news conference. The girl later died as a result of her injuries. After setting the woman’s house on fire, the gunman went to the university hospital, Erasmus Medical Center, where he entered a classroom and shot dead a 46-year-old teacher. The man was arrested near the hospital, where he also set a fire. His motive was unknown. “We have been shocked by a horrible incident. Shots were fired in two different places in the city. Many people witnessed it,” Rotterdam Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb said. “Emotions in the city are very high. My condolences go out to the victims.” “The suspect was known to law enforcement and in 2021, he was prosecuted and convicted for animal abuse,” said Hugo Hillenaar, Rotterdam’s chief prosecutor. Videos posted online showed police instructing students, some wearing medical gowns, to run outside as heavily armed arrest teams arrived at the scene. One video showed a man in handcuffs wearing what appeared to be camouflage pants. Police said there were no indications of a second shooter."
Emi­rati and Egypt­ian cen­tral banks agree to cur­ren­cy swap deal,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/emirati-and-egyptian-central-banks-agree-to-currency-swap-deal,Deal al­lows the two cen­tral banks to ex­change up to five bil­lion Emi­rati dirhams and 42 bil­lion Egypt­ian pounds.,"The central banks of the United Arab Emirates and Egypt have agreed to a currency exchange deal, which could bolster thestruggling Egyptian economy. A joint news release on Thursday said the agreement would allow the two central banks to exchange up to five billion Emirati dirhams and 42 billion Egyptian pounds, or roughly the equivalent of $1.36bn. The Egyptian pound haslost more than 50 percent of its valueagainst the dollar in the last 18 months, and the country is suffering from a shortage of foreign currency. Egypt, the Middle East’s most populous country, is the world’s largest importer of grain. Its supplies traditionally have come from Eastern Europe, so it has been hit hard by the fallout of the Ukraine war. Last month, Egypt’s annual inflation rate stood at 39.7 percent, more than double compared with the same month last year, when it recorded 15.3 percent. Currency swap arrangements are usually deployed when nations are seeking to shore up central and domestic banks by providing them with extra liquidity in the form of a foreign currency. “It seems again that the UAE is providing Egypt with financial support,” James Swanston, an economist specialising in the Middle East and North Africa, told The Associated Press. “Egypt’s central bank needs more ammunition to prop up its currency.” The UAE and the other Gulf states have been chief backers of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s government since it came to power in 2013. Estimates have suggested more than $100bn in Gulf money has gone to Cairo via Central Bank deposits, fuel aid and other support since then. The heads of the Emirati and Egyptian central banks both said Thursday’s deal would enhance cooperation between the two allied countries, but gave few further details about the agreement.  Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that Egypt had removed a key concern that has held up a review of a $3bn rescue programme with the International Monetary Fund. The IMF believes Egypt – its second-biggest borrower after Argentina – is now more willing to carry out a sale of state assets following several high-profile deals, said the report. However,presidential elections set for Decemberhave made it difficult for the Egyptian government to satisfy the IMF’s demand to devalue the pound, as that would add pressure on cash-strapped consumers. The slow progress of Egypt’s reforms could mean that a breakthrough on the already delayed review might not be possible this year, a further blow to investor confidence in the country’s $470bn economy.

Is the Ar­me­nia-Azer­bai­jan fight for Nagorno-Karabakh fi­nal­ly over?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/is-the-armenia-azerbaijan-fight-for-nagorno-karabakh-finally-over,"Af­ter two ma­jor wars and a re­cent light­ning Azer­bai­jani of­fen­sive, the self-styled re­pub­lic will be dis­solved.","“Welcome to Karabakh Telecom. The number you have dialled doesn’t exist,” says an emotionless female voice. The number belongs to an ethnic Armenian woman stuck in Stepanakert, the now-former de facto capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, a separatist statelet deep in the mountains of Azerbaijan that has not been recognised even by its main backer, Armenia. The woman’s husband was wounded and suffered heavy burns after afuel storage explodedon Tuesday and killed dozens near Stepanakert, a city known as Khakendi to Azerbaijan. A day later, he was flown to Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, but the family is still in Stepanakert amid dire shortages of food, medical drugs and other bare essentials. “This is a nightmare. It’s just a trap,” the woman’s relative in Ukraine told Al Jazeera. “All my family – three aunts, their children, grandchildren, my grandfather – are all homeless.” Also homeless are tens of thousands of ethnic Armenians fleeing Nagorno-Karabakh after more than three decades of its de facto independence, proclaimed on September 2, 1991. The proclamation followed the first war between two ex-Soviet nations, Armenia and Azerbaijan. It claimed some 30,000 lives and uprooted hundreds of thousands of Armenians and Azeris who mostly fled to Russia. Armenian and separatist forces seized seven districts surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh that linked the statelet with Armenia and became a no-man’s land dotted with ghost towns and minefields. The stalemate was written off as one of the former USSR’s “frozen conflicts”, in which the separatists and resource-poor Armenia seemed to be punching well above their military and economic weight. Triumphant separatist leaders came to power in Armenia, forming a “Karabakh clan” widely accused of corruption that stifled economic growth and foreign investment. They also allegedly misappropriated lavish donations from diaspora Armenians for new weaponry. After almost three decades of poverty, isolation and flare-ups of violence, the separatists lost the districts and other key areas in a 2020 war with Azerbaijan. After 32 years and 26 days of unrecognised independence, and one more flare-up earlier this month, Nagorno-Karabakhceased to exist. On Thursday, separatist leader Samvel Shakhramanyan signed a decree saying that the region’s state institutions will be dismantled and the statelet, known locally and in Armenia as Artsakh, will be no more by January 1, 2024.  Also on Thursday, David Babayan, Karabakh’s former top diplomat, surrendered to Azeri authorities. A day earlier, Ruben Vardanyan, an ethnic Armenian who made billions in Russia but moved to Karabakh and served as one of its “ministers,” was arrested and taken to the Azeri capital, Baku. In Azerbaijan, the news was met with jubilation. “Today is a historic day, and we have to pay dues to [Azerbaijan’s President Ilham] Aliyev and the Azeri soldiers,” Baku-based analyst Emil Mustafayev told Al Jazeera, adding he thinks the conflict is “definitely” over. “Today, we are witnessing how separatism ended on Azerbaijan’s territory.” He said that a “new stage” of development is ahead for Azeris and ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh, as the latter were guaranteed full citizenship rights. “Of course, the beginning will be hard; there’s distrust,” he said. “But I am sure that in 10 years, we’ll observe another picture, with the developed Karabakh and happy Armenians.” But the overwhelming majority of Karabakh’s Armenians distrust Baku’s pledges. Thousands of their cars slowly trudge towards Armenia via checkpoints with Azeri servicemen and Russian peacekeepers – and are seen from outer space.  About 85 percent of Nagorno-Karabakh’s ethnic Armenian population – which was 120,000 people strong until last week – has already left, and most of the remaining residents are likely to move, too. “My aunt is the only one left in her neighbourhood in Stepanakert, her daughter-in-law is a [medical] doctor, and the doctors will be the last to leave,” an ethnic Armenian man now living in Uzbekistan told Al Jazeera. His father is buried in Stepanakert, and he is ready to host each of his relatives. He is also adamant that the end of Nagorno-Karabakh’s independence was masterminded earlier this month by the leaders of Russia and Turkey. On September 6, Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. Russia has for decades supported Armenia and has close ties with Azerbaijan, while Turkey has strongly backed Azerbaijan, providing advanced weaponry and drones in the 2020 war. Two weeks after the meeting, four Azeri soldiers and two civilians were killed by landmines that Baku says were planted by separatists. Azeri troops fought their way into Nagorno-Karabakh, and a day later, the lightning offensive ended as Russiabrokereda ceasefire. “After their meeting, [Azeri forces] were ordered [on Karabakh], were unleashed, and ran after us,” the man said. “Putin let Armenia down, decided to bend it over.” Analysts pointed to other trends and miscalculations that led to Baku’s triumph. One of them is demography. Despite high birth rates, emigration to Armenia, Russia and the West over the years bled dry the Dubai-sized statelet, whose official population peaked at about 140,000. Armenia’s population also shrank to about 2.7 million, while oil-rich Azerbaijan boasts more than 10 million residents these days. The number of ethnic Armenians from Syria, who fled the civil war and were given free land in Nagorno-Karabakh, was small and did not reverse the population trend. “Understandably, even 140,000 could not withstand a much larger and growing population of Azerbaijan,” Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s University of Bremen told Al Jazeera. The second biggest problem was military. The separatists, Armenia, and worldwide Armenian diaspora invested little in the construction of the second line of defence installation, especially strongholds in the mountains, Mitrokhin said. They relied on obsolete stratagems and didn’t take into account new developments battle-tested in the Middle East. “They badly disguised military equipment, simply didn’t rack their brains about it,” Mitrokhin said about the 2020 war. “They omitted Baku’s efforts to modernise its military in the 2010s and didn’t buy drones and jeep-mounted mobile artillery units, something that was affordable for Armenia and Artsakh,” he said. During the 44-day-long war, separatist and Armenian troops moved in large groups or in trucks. Their trenches were wide but shallow, and their artillery and positions stayed put for days, becoming an easy target for drones. Some observers and Armenian officials claimed that the swarms of drones hitting tanks, missile systems, artillery, trenches and troops were operated from Turkey, and that Ankara allegedly dispatched “mercenaries” recruited in Syria. Armenian officials and Western media also purported that Turkey deployed thousands of “mercenaries” recruited in pro-Ankara areas of Syria. Azerbaijan and Turkey denied the claims. The war cost Azerbaijan almost 2,800 soldiers and billions of dollars spent on weaponry. And, finally, the combined economies of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh were too feeble and corrupt to support the military. “The economy was weak, riddled with crime if not mafia-like,” Mitrokhin said. “Foreign investors, especially those from the Armenian diaspora, didn’t want to invest knowing local mores – or got burned by them, to be more exact.”"
Re­pub­li­cans hold first Biden im­peach­ment hear­ing as gov’t shut­down looms,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/republicans-hold-first-biden-impeachment-hearing-as-govt-shutdown-looms,Re­pub­li­cans are in­ves­ti­gat­ing cor­rup­tion al­le­ga­tions against Biden fam­i­ly in push re­ject­ed by White House as base­less.,"Republican legislators in the United States have opened the first hearing of their impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden, promising to delve into allegations of corruption against the Biden family as agovernment shutdownlooms. As the House Oversight and Accountability Committee hearing began on Thursday morning, the Republican chair of the panel, James Comer, said the probe so far “has uncovered a mountain of evidence revealing how Joe Biden has used his public office for his family’s financial gain”. “For years, President Biden has lied to the American people about his knowledge of and participation in his family’s corrupt business schemes,” said Comer, referencing allegations that largely centre of the foreign business dealings of Biden’s son, Hunter. Republicans have sought an investigation into the Biden family’s affairs since theparty took controlof the House of Representatives at the beginning of the year, but Democrats have slammed the impeachment push as politically motivated and baseless. The White House also has rejected the corruption allegations, with a spokesman calling the inquiry “extreme politics at its worst”. Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthydirected House committeesearlier this month to open the impeachment process, saying investigations up until that point had uncovered a “culture of corruption” around the Biden family. “These are allegations of abuse of power, obstruction and corruption, and they warrant further investigation by the House of Representatives,” McCarthy told reporters on September 12.  But Democratic Party legislators say the impeachment drive aims to distract from former President Donald Trump’s legal troubles and hurt Biden’s re-election campaign. Trumpfaces four separate criminal indictmentsbut remains the frontrunner in the Republican Party’s 2024 presidential nomination race, setting up a likely rematch against Biden next year. “There is zero evidence of wrongdoing whatsoever” against Biden, Representative Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said this month. The Biden impeachment inquiry comes as McCarthy has facedmounting pressurefrom the GOP’s right flank to take action against the Democratic president. At the same time, some House Republicans also have promised to block must-pass funding legislation to keep the federal government working unless deep spending cuts are made. The US Congress faces a midnight deadline on Saturday (04:00 GMT on Sunday) to pass the funding to avoid being forced to shut down large swaths of the government. Raskin on Thursday condemned Republicans for continuing with the hearing despite the looming shutdown. “We’re 62 hours away from shutting down the government of the United States of America and Republicans are launching the impeachment drive, based on a long debunked and discredited lie,” he said during the committee hearing. Thursday’s hearingis not expected to feature witnesses with information about the Bidens or the business work of the US president’s son, Hunter. Instead, it will be a soft launch of sorts with testimony from outside experts in tax law, criminal investigations and constitutional legal theory. Lawmakers will hear from a forensic accountant, a former US Department of Justice official and a law professor.  Republicans have accused Biden and his family of personally profiting from policies he pursued as vice president during former President Barack Obama’s administration between 2009 and 2017. Separately, they also allege the Justice Department interfered with a tax investigation ofHunter Biden. They have yet to provide any evidence of improper conduct by President Biden. “House Republicans have been investigating the President for 9 months, and they’ve turned up no evidence of wrongdoing,” White House spokesman Ian Sams wrote on social media earlier this month. It is unclear if House Republicans, who have a narrow 221-212 majority, would have the votes at the end of the inquiry to support actual impeachment. But even if that vote succeeded, it is highly unlikely that the Senate, where Democrats hold a 51-49 majority, would vote to remove Biden from office."
France’s Macron pro­pos­es ‘a form of au­ton­o­my’ for Cor­si­ca af­ter ri­ots,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/frances-macron-proposes-a-form-of-autonomy-for-corsica-after-riots,The pro­pos­al comes more than a year af­ter the is­land saw ri­ots over the killing of in­de­pen­dence fight­er Yvan Colon­na.,"French President Emmanuel Macron has proposed to give a form of autonomy to the Mediterranean island of Corsica. The proposal came on Thursday, more than a year afterwidespread violencebroke out over the killing in a mainland prison of independence fighter Yvan Colonna. “We should have the courage to establish a form of autonomy for Corsica within France,” Macron on Thursday told the island’s parliament in Ajaccio, which is currently controlled by nationalists. “We would all be failing if we left things as they are,” he added. Colonna – jailed for life over the 1998 murder of the region’s prefect Claude Erignac – was stabbed to death by another inmate. Colonna’s killing triggered “unbelievable violence that brought Corsica to the brink of widespread conflict”, the island’s executive Gilles Simeoni told the president. Corsicans have long wanted more say on their own affairs, as well as official status for their language and protection from outsiders buying up land – two thorny requests that Paris is reluctant to grant. “Corsica must … become the autonomous territory it ought to be,” regional parliament Speaker Marie-Antoinette Maupertuis told Macron before his speech. The island’s young people especially “feel hugely dispossessed”, she added. Macron promised to introduce legislation that would “fully anchor Corsica in the French republic, and recognise the uniqueness of its Mediterranean island nature and its relationship with the world”. He set a deadline of six months for the island’s politicians to reach an agreement with Paris on a new law that would change the French constitution to amend Corsica’s status. “There are no red lines, just the ideals of the republic,” Macron added.

Mus­lim man lynched in In­dia ‘for tak­ing a ba­nana’ at Hin­du tem­ple event,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/muslim-man-lynched-in-india-for-taking-a-banana-at-hindu-temple-event,Mob ties the 22-year-old to a pole and beats him to death over al­le­ga­tions he stole ‘prasad’ or re­li­gious of­fer­ing.,"New Delhi, India– Sitting outside his home in a narrow lane in India’s capital, Mohammad Wajid recounts the killing of his 22-year-old son to a TV journalist. Inside, the four sisters of Mohammad Ishaq look sullen as they huddle together at their dimly lit house in New Delhi’s Sundar Nagri area on Wednesday. “I have lost everything,” Ishaq’s father Abdul Wajid told Al Jazeera as his eyes welled up with tears and his voice broke. At around 5am on Tuesday, a mob tied Ishaq to an iron pole with a leather belt and beat him up mercilessly on suspicion that he had stolen “prasad”, or a ritualistic offering, at a prayer event organised by the area’s Hindus to observe the Ganesh Chaturthi festival. The event was held three lanes away from Ishaq’s house in Sunder Nagri area of the Indian capital. “My son was killed because he ate prasad,” Wajid, 60, said. “Those who killed my son found it offensive that a Muslim touched their prasad.” Wajid, who sells vegetables in a pushcart, said his Hindu customers often offer him the prasad and he accepts it without a second thought. “Prasad is a gift from bhagwan or Allah. I do not refuse it.” Ishaq’s sister Uzma told Al Jazeera her brother was lynched “for taking a banana” and the mob left him tied to the pole after the brutal assault. “His nails were broken, some taken out and his fingers had cuts. He was brutally beaten because he was a Muslim,” she said. “He was unable to speak and his condition was critical.” Uzma said Ishaq was found lying on the road by a boy from their neighbourhood who picked him up and brought him home. He succumbed to his injuries a few hours later at his home. Ishaq’s family said they did not take him to hospital. The police said they were informed about the incident after he had passed away. As a video of the assault went viral on social media, people demanded action by the police, which registered a case of murder and arrested six people. “The initial inquiry has found that a group of men stopped him on the suspicion that he was a thief and then they tied and beat him.” Joy N Tirkey, the police official in the area, said in a video statement. According to the neighbours, Ishaq was mentally challenged. “He was a simple boy who did not bring any harm to anyone,” autorickshaw driver Mohammad Saleem, who lives in the same lane, told Al Jazeera. He said Ishaq would help everyone in the lane carry their load. “He was a good boy. He never said no. We would pay him 20 or 50 rupees for the job.” Wajid wants justice for the killing of his only son. “We are so far satisfied with the police action but we want the men who killed my son to receive the same fate,” he said. Assaults and mob lynchings, mainly of Muslims,have been rising in Indiasince Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in 2014. The government denies the allegation. Dozens of Muslims have been lynched or attacked by far-right Hindu mobs over suspicion of killing cows, whose slaughter is banned in most Indian states because some Hindus consider cows sacred. Sharjeel Usmani a New Delhi-based Muslim student activist, said Ishaq’s lynching reveals “a dark reality about a shift in how a section of Hindu society practices their religion”. “Lynching a Muslim has become akin to a ritual and that’s something Hindu leaders must think about,” he said. Bano, who goes by one name and lives in the house opposite Wajid’s, told Al Jazeera no politician has visited the family so far. “They are poor people. They should be helped but we know no one will come because we are Muslim,” she said. Additional reporting by Sameer Mushtaq"
"Ger­many, Is­rael sign ‘his­toric’ $3.5bn mis­sile shield deal",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/germany-israel-sign-historic-3-5bn-missile-shield-deal,The sale of Ar­row 3 hy­per­son­ic mis­sile sys­tem is the biggest ever deal for Is­rael’s mil­i­tary in­dus­try.,"Germany has signed a deal to acquire the Israeli-made Arrow 3 hypersonic missile system that will become a key part of Europe’s defence against air attack. The signing of the deal in Berlin on Thursday was a “historic day” for both countries, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said at a news conference alongside his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant. Worth about $3.5bn (3.3 billion euros), the sale is the biggest ever deal for Israel’s military industry. The Arrow 3 system would make “German air defence ready for the future”, Pistorius said. Germany has led a push to bolster NATO’s air defences in Europe after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, urging allies to buy deterrence systems together. “We can see with the daily Russian attacks on Ukraine how important antiair defence is,” Pistorius said. The signing of the deal was a “moving event for every Jew”, looking back at the events of the Holocaust, Gallant said. “Only 80 years since the end of the second world war yet Israel and Germany join hands today in building a safer future,” he said. The long-range Arrow 3 system, designed to shoot down missiles above the Earth’s atmosphere, is powerful enough to offer protective cover for neighbouring European Union states. The system was developed and produced by Israel and the United States and the sale had to beapprovedby Washington before it could be finalised. The system was first deployed at an Israeli airforce base in 2017 and has been used to protect Israel against attacks from Iran and Syria. Arrow 3 is a “mobile system” that can be deployed depending on the threats faced, according to manufacturer Israel Aerospace Industries. The money for the deal comes from a landmark 100-billion-euro ($105bn)fundunveiled by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to bolster the country’s defences in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. More than a dozen European countries have so far signed up to Germany’s common air defence project, the European Sky Shield Initiative. The Sky Shield project would involve joint procurement for short-, medium- and long-range systems, including the German-made IRIS-T, the American Patriot system and Arrow 3. Some of Germany’s neighbours have however so far declined to sign up to the pact, including France and Poland. Officials in Paris have argued instead for an air defence system using European equipment. Berlin has said it expects the Arrow 3 system to be delivered in the final quarter of 2025."
Amer­i­can sol­dier Travis King re­turns to US af­ter re­lease from North Ko­rea,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/american-soldiertravis-king-returns-to-us-after-release-from-north-korea,"King lands at US army base in Texas, more than two months af­ter he was de­tained for il­le­gal­ly cross­ing into North Ko­rea.","An American soldier released after more than two months in North Korea’s custody has returned to the United States, a US official confirmed. Travis King arrived at a US military base in the state of Texas around 05:30 GMT on Thursday, the official told the Reuters news agency. Video aired on Thursday by a Texas news station also appeared to show King, dressed in a dark top, walking off a plane in San Antonio. King wasreleased into US custodya day earlier, more than two months after he ran into North Korea across the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates the country from South Korea. Pyongyang said on Wednesday that it “decided to expel” the 23-year-old US soldier after concluding an investigation over his unlawful entry in July. A report in the official KCNA news agency said King, who is Black, “confessed that he illegally intruded into the territory of [North Korea] as he harboured ill feelings against inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination within the US army and was disillusioned about the unequal US society”. King bolted into North Korea while ona tourof the southern side of an inter-Korean truce village, Panmunjom.  The border between the two Koreas is heavily fortified but at the Joint Security Area (JSA), the frontier is marked only by a low concrete divider and is relatively easy to cross, despite the presence of soldiers on both sides. King was serving nearly two months in a South Korean prison for assault. He was released on July 10 and was to be sent home to Fort Bliss, Texas, where he could have faced additional military discipline and discharge from the service. But he managed to leave the airport and eventually crossed into North Korea on July 18. It remains unclear whether King will face any charges or disciplinary action upon his return to the United States. Washington has thanked Sweden and China for facilitating King’s release, with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan saying on Wednesday that Beijing had helped him transit out of North Korea. The Swedish government, which represents US interests in North Korea because Washington has no diplomatic presence in the country, retrieved King in North Korea and brought him to China. The State Department said the US ambassador to Beijing, Nicholas Burns, met King in Dandong, China, a city bordering North Korea. King flew from there to Shenyang, China, then to Osan Air Force Base in South Korea, before continuing his voyage back to the US. Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told the Reuters news agency that Pyongyang appears to have concluded King’s criminal background made him “unfit” for propaganda purposes.  “North Korea could have decided to release King relatively quickly after seeing little advantage in keeping him,” said Yang. The professor added that the North Korean authorities may have opted to use the case “as a chance to highlight themselves as a ‘normal state,’ showing that they are no longer using these detainees for political, diplomatic purposes”. According to US officials, North Korea received nothing in exchange for the soldier’s release. “We made no concessions as part of securing his return,” US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters on Wednesday. That same day, Jonathan Franks, a spokesperson for King’s mother, Claudine Gates, said: “Ms Gates will be forever grateful to the United States Army and all its interagency partners for a job well done.” After arriving in the US, King is expected to undergo a medical review at Brooke Army Medical Center, a hospital at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston. US basketball star Brittney Griner was treated there in December after aprisoner swap with Russiaended her 10 months in Russian detention. “The Army’s focus right now is on ensuring the soldier’s well-being and privacy. His status will be addressed at a later time by the chain of command,” spokesman Bryce Dubee told the AFP news agency on Thursday. "
"MS Swami­nathan, sci­en­tist be­hind In­dia’s ‘green rev­o­lu­tion’, dies at 98",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/ms-swaminathan-scientist-behind-indias-green-revolution-dies-at-98,In­dia mourns death of the ar­chi­tect of the 1960s’ ‘green rev­o­lu­tion’ that end­ed chron­ic food short­ages in the coun­try.,"Mankombu Sambasivan Swaminathan, a renowned agricultural scientist who revolutionised India’s farming and was a key architect of the country’s “Green Revolution”, has died. He was 98. Swaminathan died of age-related illness on Thursday at his home in the southern city of Chennai after an illustrious academic career that garnered him 84 honorary doctorates from some of the world’s top universities. In the late 1960s and 70s, the agriculturalist and plant geneticist was instrumental in bringing industrial farming to India, making the country self-sufficient in food and reducing widespread hunger. India’s Green Revolution, as it was known, turned the northern states of Punjab and Haryana into breadbasket for wheat and rice production, helping low-income farmers. The initiative, now dubbed a transformational era in Indian agriculture, introduced high-yielding cereal varieties and expanded the use of irrigation and fertilisers. Grain production increased exponentially at a time when India was beset with widespread starvation. His work breeding wheat and rice strains with improved yields, and training farmers to cultivate them, helped transform India from a starving nation into a food exporter. “At a very critical period in our nation’s history, his groundbreaking work in agriculture transformed the lives of millions and ensured food security for our nation,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “His passion to see India progress was exemplary.”  Swaminathan was awarded his doctorate in genetics from Cambridge University in 1952 but turned down a professorship in the United States after resolving to return to post-independence India and “serve the nation”. Memories were still fresh of the Bengal famine of 1943 at the twilight of British colonial rule when up to 3.8 million people died of hunger. He began collaborating with US agronomist Norman Borlaug, whose own contributions to improving world food supply won him the Nobel Peace Prize. After Prime Minister Indira Gandhi took office in 1966, Swaminathan was given free rein to implement a new agricultural programme. At the time, India’s economy was hobbled by chronic food shortages that left it dependent on foreign aid, but by the early 1970s, the new techniques had made it self-sufficient. “Crisis is a mother of invention. We faced a crisis in the 1960s and we succeeded,” he told AFP news agency in 2008. Swaminathan was the 1971 recipient of the Ramon Magsaysay Award, popularly known as Asia’s equivalent of the Nobel, along with a laundry list of other accolades. For his work, Swaminathan was named one of the 20 most influential Asians of the 20th century by Time magazine, alongside independence hero Mahatma Gandhi and the revolutionary poet and artist Rabindranath Tagore. Swaminathan also held administrative positions in various agricultural research institutes in India and served as a top planner at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research between 1972 and 1979. He received the Padma Shri, one of the Indian government’s top honours, in 1967. Swaminathan also briefly served as a legislator in India’s upper house of the parliament. He was survived by his three daughters following the death of his wife last year, media reports said."
UN chief says Pak­istan floods ‘lit­mus test for cli­mate jus­tice’ as aid lags,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/un-chief-says-pakistan-floods-litmus-test-for-climate-justice-as-aid-lags,"Fund de­lays ‘un­der­min­ing peo­ple’s ef­forts to re­build lives’, Guter­res says dur­ing spe­cial UNGA ses­sion on cat­a­stro­phe.","Islamabad, Pakistan– United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged the international community to help Pakistan recover from last year’scatastrophic floods, calling it a “litmus test for climate justice”. Addressing the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in New York on Wednesday, Guterres said Pakistan is a “double victim – of climate chaos and of our outdated and unjust global financial system that prevents middle-income countries from accessing much-needed resources to invest in adaptation and resilience”. The UN chief said Pakistan is responsible for less than 1 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, but its people are 15 times more likely to die from climate-related disasters than people elsewhere. “Billions were pledged” by rich nations in theaftermath of the floods, he said, “but the vast majority was in loans”. And Pakistan is still waiting for much of the funding, he added. “Delays are undermining people’s efforts to rebuild their lives,” Guterres said during a special UNGA session dedicated to the catastrophe.  The2022 floods, caused by record monsoon rains and melting glaciers, killed more than 1,700 people and destroyed 2 million homes, worsening an ongoing economic crisis in the country. The catastrophe pushed an estimated nine million more people below the poverty line in Pakistan. The government estimated the deluge caused damage worth more than $30bn as it sought immediate global help. The UN and the Pakistani government held a donors conference in January, in which about $10bn were pledged. Guterres on Wednesday said 69 percent of that target had been reached but a large part of it was in loans. Last week, Pakistani caretaker Prime Minister Anwar ul-Haq Kakar said the government is trying to get $10bn as pledged by the donors. “We are trying to ensure that the amounts promised and pledged to us are dispersed to Pakistan and are spent on those affected by the floods,” he said. Addressing UNGA on Friday, Kakar said Pakistan’s recovery plan is estimated to cost $13bn and details of specific projects were being submitted to donors. “I hope our development partners will accord priority to the allocation of funds,” he said. Kakar said Pakistan wants developed nations to honour their commitments to provide $100bn annually in climate financing to less-developed nations.  Pakistani climate expert Ali Tauqeer Sheikh told Al Jazeera the flood-relief funds are “monopolised by the federal government while rehabilitation work is to be conducted by the provincial governments where flood damage took place”. Sheikh said such lack of transparency leads to grievances. “A broad plan was prepared and shared with the global community for rehabilitation, but it did not include specifics of how funds will be spent, what areas required urgent attention, and there was no detailed investment plan made,” he said. Quratulain Rizwan, project manager for Indus Consortium, an umbrella group of civil society organisations working for the flood victims, told Al Jazeera the situation in Sindh province, one of the worst affected provinces, is dire. “We are working in five worst-affected districts of Sindh, and there are still hundreds of acres of agricultural land under water,” she told Al Jazeera. Rizwan said many villagers complain that the government has yet to rebuild schools and houses. “The government used to give cash handouts, but we have many people complaining that even this funding has slowed down. Schools and dispensaries remain closed because they have not been rebuilt after the floods,” she said."
"Ugan­da’s anti-LGBTQ law caus­ing wave of rights abus­es, ac­tivists say",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/ugandas-anti-lgbtq-law-causing-wave-of-rights-abuses-activists-say,Rights groups say a cli­mate of fear has been un­leashed on LGBTQ in­di­vid­u­als in Ugan­da since the law was passed in May.,"The passage of one of the world’s harshest anti-gay laws by Uganda’s government has unleashed a torrent of abuse against LGBTQ people, mostly committed by private individuals, rights groups say. The Anti-Homosexuality Act (AHA),enacted in May, prescribes the death penalty for certain same-sex acts. At least six people have been charged under it, including two accused of the capital offence of “aggravated homosexuality”. But a report, authored by a committee of the Convening for Equality (CFE) coalition and made public on Thursday, says the main perpetrators of human rights abuses against LGBTQ people this year – including torture, rape, arrest and eviction – were private individuals. The report said this pointed to the way the law and the rampant homophobic rhetoric that preceded its passage earlier in the year had radicalised the public against the LGBTQ community. For example, the report said, mob-aided arrests had become increasingly common “because AHA has put LGBTIQ+ persons on the spot as persons of interest, and the public seems to be the custodians of enforcing the witch hunt”. Between January 1 and August 31, researchers documented 306 rights violations based on the victims’ sexual orientation and gender identity, with state actors as the perpetrators in 25 of those cases. By contrast, reports by rights activists in 2020 and 2021 found that state actors were responsible for nearly 70 percent of the rights violations documented in those years. The report did not provide comparative figures for 2022. The report’s authors said they had documented 18 instances in which the police conducted forced anal examinations of people in their custody to gather “evidence” of homosexuality. “Surviving a forced anal examination at police [stations] is something that lives with you forever,” it quoted one survivor as saying. Police spokesperson Fred Enanga told Reuters news agency that he had not yet read the report and could not comment. The report cautioned that its statistics could not be considered exhaustive given the difficulties LGBTQ people face in reporting violations. The climate of fear and intimidation unleashed by the law has also led to rising cases of mental health conditions in the LGBTQ community, including suicidal thoughts, it said. Since it was enacted in May, the law has drawn widespread condemnation from across the world. In June, the United Statesimposed travel restrictions on Ugandan officialsin response to the legislation and the World Bankannouncedin August that it was pausing project financing to the country."
Homes flood­ed as Storm Elias hits bat­tered city in cen­tral Greece,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/flooded-homes-as-storm-elias-hits-battered-volos-in-central-greece,Tor­ren­tial rain pum­mels city still reel­ing from ef­fects of dev­as­tat­ing Storm Daniel ear­li­er this month.,"A powerful storm has hammered parts of central Greece, sweeping away roads, smashing bridges and flooding homes, just three weeks afterheavy rains killed16 people in the wider region. The new storm – called Elias – caused extensive flooding in the central city of Volos on Thursday and left hundreds stranded in nearby mountain villages. The fire service carried out multiple rescues and evacuations, authorities said. “All of Volos has turned into a lake,” the city’s mayor, Achilleas Beos, told state television. “People’s lives are in danger. Even I remained trapped, and 80 percent of the city is without power … I don’t know where God found so much water. It’s like the story of Noah’s Ark.” Authorities have stopped all vehicles from going onto the roads. “People can’t stand this any more. I cannot understand nature’s rage. Protect yourselves,” said Beos, urging residents to stay home.  Residents in Volos, a city of nearly 140,000, used plastic buckets to scoop mud out of their homes to try to protect their belongings. Among them was 83-year-old Apostolis Dafereras, who has lived in a suburb of the city since 1955. “I have never seen anything like this,” Dafereras said as he tried to push mud and flood water out of his home.  More than 250 people have been evacuated from the area since Storm Elias struck on Wednesday afternoon, the fire brigade said on Thursday, adding that it had so far received 1,200 calls for help. Authorities said the worst damage was reported around Volos and in northern parts of the nearby island of Evia, an area vulnerable to flooding due to massive wildfires two years ago. Water levels in the city and its suburbs rose rapidly in a few hours, and a nearby stream overflowed, adding to the flooding. Elias is the second major storm to hit the region since Storm Daniel – the most intense rainfall to hit Greece since records began in 1930 – battered the region for three days earlier in September. Many Volos residents said the authorities were still dealing with the aftermath of Daniel and had not been adequately prepared for another storm. “This was foretold,” said Yannis Gavanoudis, a 70-year-old pensioner. “They [authorities] didn’t do their job properly.” Daniel turned central Greece into an inland sea, flooding homes and damaging road infrastructure and farms near Volos, Karditsa and Larissa. Tens of thousands of animals drowned and crops were washed away, and residents of the flooded areas are still struggling to recover. Daniel also wrought devastation across the Mediterranean, moving from Greece to Libya, where thousands died in ahuge floodin the coastal city of Derna."
"Turk­ish neu­tral­i­ty: How Er­do­gan man­ages ties with Rus­sia, Ukraine amid war",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/turkish-neutrality-how-erdogan-manages-ties-with-russia-ukraine-amid-war,"‘The West is re­li­able, Rus­sia is equal­ly re­li­able,’ the Turk­ish pres­i­dent re­cent­ly said, re­flect­ing his bal­anc­ing act.","Kyiv, Ukraine– In Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s opinion, Russia and the West are “equally” reliable and trustworthy. That is what the Turkish president said on September 18 commenting on the collective West’s dependability and on his frustration with Turkey’s long-stalled attempts to join the European Union. “To the extent the West is reliable, Russia is equally reliable,” he told the PBS, a US broadcaster. “For the last 50 years, we have been waiting at the doorstep of the EU, and, at this moment in time, I trust Russia just as much as I trust the West.” After his September 4 visit to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin, Erdogan also believes the Kremlin’s master wants a prompt end to his faltering quagmire in Ukraine. “Mr Putin is on the side of ending this war as soon as possible. That’s what he said. And I believe his remarks,” Erdogan said. Erdogan may appear to sound naive, but he is directing a careful balancing act between the warring sides, the West, China and his own domestic audience. His equidistant position reaped enormous economic and political benefits both for him and his nation hobbled by a five years-long recession and traumatised by the February 6 earthquake that killed tens of thousands. “Erdogan’s geopolitics is based on balancing on three points of geopolitical confrontation – the West, Russia, China,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. “From every direction, Erdogan gets maximal profit – markets, technologies and the economic modernisation from the West, cheap raw materials, fuel and a natural gas hub from Russia, transit [of goods] and investments from China,” he said. To some Ukrainians, this balance may look cynical. “He’s like a market trader – he smiles and asks about your family, but all he wants is your money and your recommendation to another buyer,” Valentin Aleksashenko, a Kyiv-based IT analyst who regularly holidays in Turkey, told Al Jazeera. But Erdogan’s stance does help Kyiv’s war effort. He calls Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “dear friend”, recently gave him a red-carpet reception in Istanbul, and has helped negotiate the release of war prisoners and the extension of the “grain deal” to ship Ukrainian wheat via the Black Sea. The Bayraktar attack drones produced by the company that belongs to Erdogan’s son-in-law proved to be so lethally effective against Russian troops that Ukrainians name radio stations, cell phone plans, and business lunch menus after them. Erdogan’s reluctance to take sides works for him at home – especially since his voters realise how reluctant most EU member states are to let their nation in, and how Western “double standards” on migration spur anti-Western sentiments among them, said Seda Demiralp of Istanbul’s Isik University. “His voters are convinced that an independent position benefits Turkish interests most. Turkish voters do appreciate closer ties with the West while at the same time realising Turkey is never treated as an equal partner by the West,” she told Al Jazeera. “From Erdogan’s point of view, it’s perfectly rational to pursue policies that are not seen as exclusively supporting one party. He can neither alienate the West nor Russia,” Gonul Tol, a Turkish-born analyst with the Middle East Institute, a think tank in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera. On the other hand, Brussels, Washington and Moscow have no choice but to approach Erdogan time and again.“From Western and Russian points of view, no matter how frustrated they get with Erdogan, they, too, think they must cooperate with Turkey,” Tol said. And then there is a personal connection between Erdogan and Putin, whose political trajectories are somewhat similar. Both were born in the 1950s and have been in power for more than two decades pursuing what critics call increasingly authoritarian and nationalist policies, though Erdogan and his supporters deny this. Both are nostalgic about their nations’ imperial heyday – and strive to revive it despite all odds. And both try to find common ground. “Time has shown that both leaders follow their nations’ interests, but can agree and compromise at the same time,” said Emil Mustafayev, an analyst based in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, Turkey’s key ally in the former Soviet Union. “And despite their myriad disagreements, it makes their relationship somewhat unique in today’s world,” he told Al Jazeera. Both are rewriting the centuries-old history of very uneasy ties. Russian czars and Ottoman sultans were at war a dozen times, and Czar Nicolas I famously called Turkey “Europe’s sick man” before the Crimean war that pitted Turkey and Western powers against Russia in the 1850s. A century and a half later, Moscow looks like “Europe’s sick man” as its annexation of Crimea and the war in Ukraine prompted tensions between roughly the same players. In 2015, during Russia’s campaign to rescue Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s crumbling regime, Turkish air force downed a Russian fighter jet that Ankara claimed violated its air space. The incident provoked tensions as Moscow imposed sanctions, banned charter flights to Turkey and ordered holiday companies to “evacuate” tens of thousands of tourists. Gazprom, Russia’s natural gas exporter, suspended the construction of a 1,100-kilometers-long (683-mile) pipeline to Turkey. But tensions soon ended, Russian gas was pumped to Turkey and farther to Eastern Europe, and Moscow even allowed Ankara to defer a $600m gas bill. After the disruption of Nord Stream, a Russian natural gas pipeline to Germany, the Kremlin decided to create a “gas hub” in Turkey. But the plan stalled because of something that could be emblematic of ties between Erdogan and Putin – the sides cannot agree on who is going to have more control over the hub, Reuters reported in mid-September."
Po­lice search foot­ball ref­er­ee head­quar­ters in Barcelona graft probe,https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2023/9/28/police-search-football-referee-headquarters-in-barcelona-graft-probe,Bar­ca face in­ves­ti­ga­tion for sus­pect­ed ‘ac­tive bribery’ as part of a probe into sus­pect­ed ref­er­ee­ing cor­rup­tion.,"Police in Spain have searched the headquarters of the country’s football referee committee as part of a probe intopayments made by Barcelonafootball club to a firm owned by a former official of the body. Prosecutors suspect the club paid millions of dollars to the company of Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira, the former vice president of Spanish football’s refereeing committee, between 2001 and 2018, to try to influence referee decisions. The Barcelona court investigating the case on Thursday ordered the search of the headquarters “as part of the investigation into the suspect payments made by the Catalan club” to Negreira, the regional court oversight body said in a statement. The Guardia Civil police force, which was searching the committee’s base located in the headquarters of Spain’s football federation in Las Rozas on the outskirts of Madrid, did not expect to make any arrests as part of the operation, a spokesman said. In March, Spanish prosecutors charged Barcelona as well as two of the club’s former presidents, Josep Maria Bartomeu and Sandro Rosell, and Negreira and his son, Javier Enriquez Negreira, with corruption over the affair. The club was accused of corruption in sports, fraudulent management and the falsification of mercantile documentation.  Prosecutors said between 2001 and 2018, Barcelona paid $7.7m to Negreira, a former referee who was a part of the federation’s refereeing committee from 1994 to 2018. The investigation began after Spain’s tax authorities identified irregularities in tax payments made between 2016 and 2018 by the company Dasnil 95, which is owned by Negreira. Dasnil 95 reportedly received payments from Barcelona between those years. Barcelona have denied any wrongdoing or conflict of interest, saying it paid for technical reports on referees but never tried to influence their decisions in games. Barcelona’s archrivals Real Madrid had joined the prosecution in the lawsuit as a damaged party."
Cheer­ing In­di­an crowds wel­come Pak­istan crick­et team in Hy­der­abad,https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2023/9/28/cheering-indian-crowds-welcome-pakistan-team-before-icc-cricket-world-cup,Hun­dreds of In­di­an fans greet Pak­istani play­ers upon their ar­rival in Hy­der­abad for the ICC Crick­et World Cup.,"The Pakistan cricket team has been greeted with warm applause and loud cheers by hundreds of Indian fans upon its arrival before theICC Cricket World Cup 2023, which starts on October 5. The contingent landed at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad late on Wednesday and was given a raucous welcome by local fans who had lined up to catch a glimpse of the cricket stars from across the border. Videos posted by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on X, formerly Twitter, showed fans taking photographs with their phones and shouting the Pakistani players’ names to catch their attention as the squad walked past them inside the terminal. Bigger crowds awaited the players outside the terminal and along their route out of the airport. They let out loud cheers for Pakistan’s captain and star batter Babar Azam when he smiled and waved back while boarding the team’s bus.  The squad was scheduled to leave for the United Arab Emirates last week for a two-day team bonding session in Dubai before proceeding to India, but avisa delaymeant the departure was delayed by a few days, leaving the team’s plans in disarray. Prior to setting off for India, Azam said he expected Indian fans to support Pakistan despite decades of tense ties between the two countries. “Most of our matches are sold out, which means Indian fans are eager to see us and support us in the stadiums,” Azam told reporters in Pakistan earlier this week. “Former players who have toured India have told us to expect Indian cricket fans to cheer for us and greet us with warmth.”  The heartwarming scenes in Hyderabad belied the diplomatic tensions that have all but stopped cross-border tourism and bilateral series due to stern restrictions on the movements of their citizens across the heavily militarised border. Both countries have beenbitter rivalssince their independence from British rule in 1947. They have fought three wars since and oftenexchange political barbsat international forums. Despite the strained relations between both governments, athletes from both nations have maintained friendly terms and are often seen sharing laughs before or after matches. Star Indian batter Virat Kohli is afirm favouritein Pakistan, where fans have been spotted wearing Pakistan cricket team’s replica shirts with Kohli’s name emblazoned on the back. Ahead of the India-Pakistan clash at the recently concluded Asia Cup, Kohli was seen animatedly chatting with Pakistan players and later went on to share jokes with them during rain delays. India’s javelin Olympic and world champion Neeraj Chopra and Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeemwrapped arms aroundeach other after their podium finish at the World Athletics Championship in Romania last month. Pakistan are set to play their first pretournament warm-up match against New Zealand in Hyderabad on Friday.

The 2023 laureates “stand up to save lives, preserve nature and safeguard the dignity and livelihoods of communities around the world”, the awards foundation said on Thursday, adding that they “fight for people’s right to health, safety, a clean environment and democracy”. This year’s prizes went to Phyllis Omido from Kenya and the groups Mother Nature Cambodia and SOS Mediterranee. They will share a cash prize, but for security reasons, its size cannot be disclosed, the awards foundation said. The 2023 honorary award was given to Eunice Brookman-Amissah from Ghana. “They care for their land and each human life connected to it: be it Indigenous communities or people risking their lives to get to safety,” Ole von Uexkull, the head of the Stockholm-based Right Livelihood Foundation, said in a statement. The Cambodian advocacy group was cited for its “fearless and engaging activism to preserve Cambodia’s natural environment in the context of a highly restricted democratic space” while the non-profit charity that operates in international waters north of Libya was credited with carrying out “life-saving humanitarian search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean Sea”. Kenyan grassroots environmental activist Omido received the award “for her groundbreaking struggle to secure land and environmental rights for local communities while advancing the field of environmental law”, it said. The foundation said Brookman-Amissah was honoured “for pioneering discussions on women’s reproductive rights in Africa, paving the way for liberalised abortion laws and improved safe abortion access”. This year, there were 170 nominees from 68 countries, the foundation said. It said the laureates will be recognised at an awards presentation in Stockholm on November 29. Created in 1980, the annual Right Livelihood Award honours efforts that the prize founder, Swedish-German philanthropist Jakob von Uexkull, felt were being ignored by the Nobel Prizes. To date, 190 laureates from 74 countries have received the award. Ole von Uexkull is a nephew of the prize founder. Previous winners include Ukrainian human rights defender Oleksandra Matviichuk, Congolese surgeon Denis Mukwege and Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. Matviichuk and Mukwege received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022 and 2018, respectively."

The chatbot was previously trained to use data up to September 2021 and was unable to provide real-time information. On Wednesday, Microsoft-backed OpenAI announced on X, formerly Twitter, that the new update allows it to move past the September 2021 cutoff and access current information on the internet.  OpenAI said that the “Browse with Bing” option is now available to users of the paid versions of ChatGPT, adding “we’ll expand to all users soon”. OpenAI had earlier tested a feature that allowed users to access the latest information through the Bing search engine within its premium ChatGPT Plus offering. This feature was integrated inMaybut disabled two months later over fears that it could allow users to bypass paywalls. The new integration works similarly toBard, a chatbot developed and launched by Google in March this year. “What OpenAI is trying to do is get in on Google’s market share,” Alex Hanna, director of research at the Distributed AI Research Institute and former research scientist at Ethical AI at Google, told Al Jazeera. There were also privacy concerns about accessing real-time information: The bot could pick up harmful material, misinformation, and copyrighted content online and display it to users, the BBC has earlier reported. Additionally, users have to enable their chat history to allow the new browser plugin to work, which means opting to share their personal data with the model. “People are at the risk of their legal data being scraped. Research has shown that with certain kinds of prompts, certain kinds of private information has been leaked through these different systems,” said Hanna. “We don’t know what is being leaked just because of how private these companies have kept their data sources.” OpenAI said the latest feature would allow websites to control how ChatGPT can interact with them. Hanna said that ChatGPT can display hallucinations, or misinformation and inaccurate information. She added that AI tools and search engines perpetuate racial and genderbiases, as proven by research including Safiya Noble’s bookAlgorithms of Oppressionwhich shows how search engine results for queries about Black women and white women differ, exposing racism and sexism within the algorithms. Earlier this week, OpenAI introducedvoice and image featuresto the chatbot, earning mixed reactions online. While some users celebrated the updates, others were concerned about AI becoming too human-like. Some users brought up how the updates might replace smaller AI startups and software engineers while others discouraged the use of ChatGPT, raising concerns about therecent lawsuitsagainst OpenAI’s violation of copyright laws and infringement of intellectual property rights."

Formerly known as the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium, the venue was renamed after a former finance minister and parliamentarian from PM Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) following his death in 2019. The move was met with some criticism but local cricket administrators said it was done to credit Jaitley for uplifting cricket in the capital. The stadium has hosted several memorable matches, including Indian leg-spinner Anil Kumble’s record-breaking achievement of taking all 10 wickets in a Test innings against Pakistan in February 1999.

Cur­few in parts of In­dia’s Ma­nipur af­ter protests over killing of stu­dents,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/curfew-in-parts-of-indias-manipur-after-protests-over-killing-of-students,"Dozens of stu­dents in­jured in vi­o­lence af­ter protests over al­leged ab­duc­tion and mur­der of two stu­dents, of­fi­cials say.","Authorities have imposed a curfew in the capital and some other places in India’s restive state of Manipur after dozens of students were injured in violence following protests against the alleged abduction and murder of two students. Ethnic violence has plunged the northeastern state bordering Myanmar into what many security experts describe as anintense civil warfought over land, jobs and political clout between its two largest local groups. “Indefinite curfew had to be implemented in Imphal and in some other districts,” L Kailun, a senior police official posted in Imphal, said on Thursday. More than 80 students were injured in Wednesday’s clashes, another police official said on condition of anonymity, adding that the situation was “extremely tense” after armed mobs vandalised an office of the governing party and hurled petrol bombs at the police parties. Mobile internet services have been suspended in the state for five days, officials said.  Since the violencefirst erupted on May 3, more than 180 people have been killed and some 50,000 have fled their homes in Manipur. More than half the state’s population of 3.2 million belongs to the mainly Hindu Meitei community, while the Kuki-Zo community, who make up about 40 percent, are predominantly Christian and live mostly in the hills. Protests reignited over the alleged kidnapping and killing of two students of the Meitei community who had gone missing in July after their bodies were found this week. The news went viral, reviving theethnic tension. The state’s chief minister, N Biren Singh, who is a leader of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), denounced the alleged murders and promised maximum punishment for the culprits. Members of the students’ families and Meitei leaders have accused Kuki-Zo fighters of killing the duo and criticised authorities for failing to end the violence. A spokesperson for a Kuki-Zo civil society group said it did not have an immediate comment to offer over the latest killings. Leaders of the opposition Congress party have accused the Modi government offailing to controlthe violence in a state governed by his Hindu nationalist party."

Hundreds of people gathered on Thursday at the Syriac Catholic Church of the Immaculate Conception in Nineveh’s Hamdaniya district to bid farewell to those killed on Tuesday night. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, who has ordered aninvestigation into the blaze, also visited Hamdaniya on Thursday to inspect the site of the fire and meet the families of the victims and survivors. Several of the dead were also buried on Wednesday afternoon in Hamdaniya, less than 24 hours after the fire. The crowd of mourners, many dressed in black, looked stunned as relatives and friends carried the coffins of the victims while other family members wailed. Some stood in silence next to photos placed on the graves of their loved ones. “Sadness has prevailed in the town. It’s as if there was a curfew imposed,” Faten Youssef, one of the survivors, said as she attended the funerals on Wednesday. “The town has transformed from happiness to grief and morning.” She said her family has promised to never attend weddings again. “My son told me that if he gets married, he will never have an event like this – just a church ceremony,” she said. More funerals are expected in the coming days as investigators continue to identify the victims, some of whom were burned beyond recognition. Most of those who attended the wedding belong to Nineveh’s Christian minority. But tragedy sent ripples of grief beyond Hamdaniya, a region of small towns with a mixture of Christians, Muslims and small minority religions in the Nineveh Plains outside the northern city of Mosul. There was no official word on the cause of the blaze, but video footage showed flames igniting from the ceiling of the reception hall as fireworks were lit up in the middle of the dance floor. A video clip showed panicked guests, estimated to be about 250, stampeding for the exits of the al-Haitham Royal Wedding Hall as flaming decorations and pieces of ceiling rained down on them.  The tragedy was the latest to hit Iraq’s Christian minority, which has dwindled to a fraction of its former size over the past decade in the face of deadly attacks. Father Rudi Saffar Khoury, a priest at the ill-fated wedding, told The Associated Press news agency: “It was a disaster in every sense of the word.” As the funerals continued on Thursday, survivors and family members of the victims raised questions about the safety of the hall as well as the government’s role in implementing building regulations. Ministry of Interior spokesman Saad Maan said the primary forensic report described a “lack of safety and security measures” at the venue. Security forces have arrested more than a dozen people linked to the operation of the hall, according to Abdullah al-Jabouri, head ofthe Nineveh Operations Command. Civil defence officials quoted by the Iraqi News Agency said the wedding hall’s exterior was covered with a highly flammable, low-cost type of “sandwich panel” cladding that is illegal in the country. The materials “collapse within minutes when a fire breaks out”, the Civil Defence Corp said. Experts said these cheaper sandwich panels don’t always meet safety standards and are especially dangerous on buildings without any breaks to slow or halt a potential blaze. Similar panels have been blamed in several previous deadly fires in Iraq. In July 2021, a blaze at a hospital in Nasiriyah that killed 60 to 92 people was determined to have been fuelled by sandwich panels."
"Pow­er­ful blast near Tashkent air­port kills one, in­jures 162",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/powerful-blast-near-uzbekistans-tashkent-airport-kills-one-injures-162,A teenag­er dies as a win­dow frame falls on him fol­low­ing the ex­plo­sion at a ware­house near the cap­i­tal’s air­port.,"One person has been reported killed and 162 others wounded in a powerful explosion at a warehouse near Tashkent airport that sparked a fire and shattered windows in apartment buildings nearby. A teenager died after a window frame fell on him, Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Health said in a statement following Thursday’s explosion. The ministry added that 138 people were treated for injuries while 24 had been hospitalised. Flights were operating as normal at the international airport in the capital, the authorities said. In video and photographs on social media, flames soared into the night sky, with a huge cloud of smoke hanging above the warehouse, but the cause of the explosion was not immediately clear. A special laboratory had been set up at the scene to investigate the blast, the emergencies ministry said. “The situation is completely under control,” it added. A social media post from Uzbek outlet Daryo said 16 fire and rescue crews were sent to fight the fire at one of the warehouses in the city’s Sergeli district near the airport. The blast damaged the windows and interiors of several houses in the surrounding area while ambulances worked to evacuate those injured, the AFP news agency reported. Explosions continued to ring out in the hours after the blaze broke out as emergency crews tackled the fire. “I woke up at night. I thought it was an earthquake,” said Koutepov Moustafo, a 72-year-old retiree who lives nearby and whose house was affected. “Then I saw the fire. My son was injured in the leg.”"
What to know about the last su­per­moon of the year,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/what-is-the-harvest-moon-all-to-know-about-the-last-supermoon-in-2023,"Ap­pear­ing big­ger than oth­er su­per­moons, the har­vest moon will rise with its ochre-red glo­ry on Thurs­day night.","Harvest moon, the last supermoon of the year – will rise on Thursday and reach its peak on Friday. Although the harvest moon follows three supermoons already this year – theblue moon being the most recent– it is particularly unique. Here is why: The harvest moon is the closest full moon to the northern hemisphere’s autumn equinox which took place on September 23. Along with marking the start of autumn, this equinox is a period when many crops reach their peak. According to the Farmer’s Almanac, “this full moon rises at nearly the sametime– around sunset- for several evenings in a row”. This results in an abundance of bright moonlight early in the evening. Normally, the moon rises approximately 50 minutes later each day as it goes through its cycle. However, during the harvest moon, this delay is reduced to a smaller interval each night, according to the Farmer’s Almanac, ranging from 15 to 20 minutes in the northern United States and only 10 to 20 minutes later as you go farther north in Canada and Europe. This supermoon has traditionally aided farmers and crews in harvesting their summer-grown crops by giving them several extra evenings of moonlight. Hence, it is called the harvest moon. In China, a festival dating back to 771 BCE also celebrates the harvest of rice and white on the night of the full moon in autumn. This year, the harvest moon will appear just after sunset on Thursday, September 28, but it will peak at 5:57am ET (09:57 GMT) on Friday. A casual stargazer will still be able to see the full moon the night before and after its peak. NASAalso recommendsusing a pair of binoculars “with a magnification of 7 at a minimum. Though a magnification of 10 or 15 will provide more detail, you may need a tripod to steady them.” At its highest point, the full moon will be at its closest point to the earth, experiencing a “lunar perigee”. And because it comes within 90 percent of the perigee, it is considered a supermoon. Theterm “supermoon”was coined in 1979 by astrologer Richard Nolle to refer to the point when the full moon is at the closest point of its orbit around the Earth.  The harvest moon has a shade of orange and red. It appears bigger and brighter than other full moons because of an optical illusion that occurs when a moon is close to the horizon. Its ochre-red colour is also more prominent when it is near the horizon. This is because the moonlight is filtered through more of the Earth’s atmospheric particles than when it is overhead. The particles tend to scatter the blue light more than the red, allowing them to penetrate the eye. Many cultures around the world celebrate the harvest moon. Chinese and South Korean cultures are two of the biggest celebrants of the Harvest Moon Festival. China has traditionally commemorated this mid-autumn festival, called Zhongqiu Jie, through family reunions, moon gazing and sharing mooncakes. In South Korea, September 29 is a national holiday as a similar festival, Chuseok, is celebrated with people travelling to their ancestral and parental homes. During this celebration, they commemorate the autumn harvest. The festivity is also known as the Harvest Moon Festival. According to ancient folklore, frost occurring in the light of the harvest moon would not kill fruit buds and blossoms, unlike frost in the dark of the moon."
Nagorno-Karabakh will ‘cease to ex­ist’ as sep­a­rate state on Jan­u­ary 1,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/nagorno-karabakh-will-cease-to-exist-as-separate-state-on-january-1,Au­thor­i­ties of the self-styled Re­pub­lic of Art­sakh or­der the dis­man­tling of all of its state in­sti­tu­tions.,"Nagorno-Karabakh authorities have ordered the dismantling of the region’s state institutions by the end of the year, saying that the separatist state will cease existing as of January 1, 2024. The decision came in a decree signed by the region’s separatist President Samvel Shakhramanyan on Thursday as more than half of the 120,000 ethnic Armenians who used to live in the enclave fled into Armenia following a military operation by Azerbaijani forces last week. The document cited the ceasefire agreement last week which ended the fighting. Under the agreement, Azerbaijan will allow the “free, voluntary and unhindered movement” of Nagorno-Karbakh residents.  Baku launched a military offensive on September 19. A day later, separatist authorities said they were forced to lay down their arms and agreed to aRussia-brokered ceasefire. While Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev promised to guarantee the rights and security of ethnic Armenians, decades of distrust, wars, mutual hatred and violence have left many residents of Nagorno-Karabakh sceptical over the possibility of the region’s peaceful reintegration into Azerbaijani territory. In recent days, long queues of cars have formed on the road linking the region to Armenia. A stream of ethnic Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh has fled the enclave. On Thursday, Armenian authoritiessaidmore than 65,000 of them have now reached Armenia. The separatist enclave is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, including by Armenia, but has been populated by a majority of ethnic Armenians who have sought to unify with Yerevan following the collapse of the Soviet Union. After Azerbaijan and Armenia announced independence in the nineties, Nagorno-Karabakh was at the centre of two wars. Armenians had full control of the territory and several districts surrounding it in 1994. But Azerbaijan regained control of much of the lost territory in 2020. The wars caused tens of thousands of civilian casualties as well as internally displaced people and refugees on both sides."
"Eu­ro­pean com­pa­nies dump­ing tox­ic ships on Bangladesh beach­es, HRW says",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/european-companies-dumping-toxic-ships-on-bangladesh-beaches-hrw-says,"HRW says firms are ditch­ing old ships for scrap in dan­ger­ous con­di­tions, killing work­ers who pull them apart.","European maritime companies are ditching their old ships for scrap on Bangladeshi beaches in dangerous and polluting conditions that have killed workers pulling them apart, says Human Rights Watch. Bangladesh’s southeastern Sitakunda beaches have emerged as one of the world’s largest shipbreaking yards, fuelling the South Asian country’s booming construction industry and its need for cheap sources of steel. European firms are among the shipping companies to have sent 520 vessels to the site since 2020, where thousands of workers take apart shipswithout protective gear. “Companies scrapping ships in Bangladesh’s dangerous and polluting yards are making a profit at the expense of Bangladeshi lives and the environment,” said HRW researcher Julia Bleckner on Thursday. “Shipping companies should stop using loopholes in international regulations and take responsibility for safely and responsibly managing their waste.” Workers told HRW they used their socks as gloves to avoid burns while cutting through molten steel, covered their mouths with shirts to avoid inhaling toxic fumes, and carried chunks of steel barefoot. “Workers described injuries from falling chunks of steel or being trapped inside a ship when it caught fire or pipes exploded,” HRW said in their report, published jointly with Belgian-based NGO Shipbreaking Platform. At least 62 workers have been killed by accidents in Sitakunda’sshipbreaking yardssince 2019, Bangladeshi environmental group Young Power in Social Action has said. Two workers died last week in separate incidents after falling from partially dismantled ships, police told AFP news agency.  The Bangladesh Ship Breakers Association (BSBA), which represents yard owners, said its members had moved to upgrade safety ahead of a new international convention on safe and environmentally sound scrapping, due to enter into force in 2025. “We are turning our shipbreaking yards into green yards even though it is expensive,” BSBA President Mohammad Abu Taher told AFP. “We are working on it. We supply protective equipment to workers.” But Fazlul Kabir Mintu, coordinator for the Danish-funded Occupational Safety and Security Information Center, said yard owners operated in a “climate of impunity” because of their outsized influence in local politics. “There is little or no attention to worker safety in dozens of yards,” he told AFP. Many ships sent to Sitakunda contained asbestos, said Repon Chowdhury, executive director of the OSHE Foundation charity that works with shipbreaking labourers. Asbestos is associated with lung cancer and other life-threatening diseases, but Chowdhury told AFP that workers were forced to mop it up with their bare hands. He added that his organisation had studied 110 shipbreaking workers for exposure to the toxic substance, finding that 33 had tested positive. “All 33 workers were victims of varying degrees of lung damage,” he said. “Of the victims three have died, while others are living in misery.”"

President Tsai Ing-wen launched the vessel – named Haikun, meaning “mythical sea creature” – on Thursday into the harbour of Kaohsiung, Taiwan’s southern port city, where tests of its seaworthiness will be conducted in the coming weeks. “In the past, a domestic made submarine was considered impossible, but today a submarine designed and built by our countrymen is in front of you,” Tsai said at the ceremony. If all goes well, the first submarine should be ready for delivery by the end of 2024 with a second planned for completion by 2027. The first submarine came with a hefty price tag of $1.54bn, but for Taiwan’s government, it is worth the cost to defend the island and its outlying territories from China’s navy. The submarines could keep China’s navy from encircling Taiwan and cutting the island off from outside resources, a move China would be expected to make if it were to attack or invade the island. Taiwan’s government also said the submarines could keep China from bypassing the First Island Chain, an imaginary line of defence connecting Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines and Indonesia. The submarines are part of Taiwan’s overall strategy of deterrence. While its military is substantially smaller than China’s, Taiwan’s aim is to make an attack as difficult as possible so it would be too costly to make it worthwhile. The government aims to build eight diesel-powered submarines to bulk out Taiwan’s existing fleet of two Dutch-made models from the 1980s and a World War II-era US submarine used only for training. The new models will come equipped with a Lockheed Martin Corp combat system and US-made MK-48 heavyweight torpedoes. China’s Communist Party claims Taiwan as a province – although it has never ruled it – and it has not ruled out the use of force to achieve its objective. Analysts said China’s massive People’s Liberation Army will be capable of invading Taiwan by 2027 although that does not mean it will do so immediately. While Taiwan buys many of its weapons and defence systems from the United States, the indigenous submarine programme aims to make Taiwan more self-sufficient. Taiwan has struggled to obtain key defence technology in the past, particularly for submarines, due to its diplomatic isolation. Seven countries reportedly provided technology to help Taiwan build its submarine fleet, a sign of how concerned some nations may feel about the prospect of China’s expansion into the Pacific. The Taiwan Strait, the 180km (117-mile) waterway dividing Taiwan from mainland Asia, is one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, so a military blockade would have a major global impact."
Viet­nam jails en­vi­ron­men­tal ac­tivist for three years over tax fraud,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/vietnam-jails-environmental-activist-for-three-years-over-tax-fraud,Rights groups con­demn sen­tence against promi­nent cam­paign­er on is­sues of cli­mate change and en­vi­ron­men­tal degra­da­tion.,"Vietnam has sentenced prominent environmental activist Hoang Thi Minh Hong to three years in prison on tax fraud charges. The state-run Thanh Nien newspaper said Hong, the founder of CHANGE, a now-defunct environmental campaign group, was convicted after a one-day trial in southern Ho Chi Minh City. She was found guilty of dodging nearly $275,000 in taxes related to CHANGE, her lawyer Nguyen Van Tu told the AFP news agency. “This conviction is a total fraud, nobody should be fooled by it,” said Ben Swanton, co-director of The 88 Project charity. “This is yet another example of the law being weaponised to persecute climate activists who are fighting to save the planet.” The United States and a number of human rights groups had expressed their concerns about Hong and the crackdown on CHANGE when she wasarrestedin June. In response to Thursday’s decision, rights group Amnesty International urged Vietnam to end its crackdown on environmental defenders. “This verdict is a self-inflicted wound on Viet Nam’s ability to tackle one of the most seismic issues of our time,” Ming Yu, Amnesty’s deputy regional director for campaigning, said in a statement, urging the international community to condemn the decision and for Vietnam to drop all criminal charges against environmental activists. “Authorities in Viet Nam must also wake up to the fact that they can only fulfil their climate goals and responsibilities by working with, rather than against, those most dedicated to the cause in their own country,” Ming added. Hong, 51, founded CHANGE in 2013 to tackle problems related to climate change, pollution and endangered wildlife. She secured international recognition for her campaigning, but abruptly shut the organisation down in October 2022 after the arrests ofother actvistsalso for alleged tax evasion. According to Amnesty, Hong is the fifth environmental defender to be arrested and accused of tax violations in the past two years. Hong’s trial came only two weeks after United States’ President Joe Biden visited VIetnam after upgrading diplomatic relations, drawing criticism that human rights issues were being overlooked. According to Human Rights Watch, there were at least 159 political prisoners in Vietnam in early September with 22 more in custody pending trial. On September 15, Hanoi police detained Ngo Thi To Nhien, executive director of the Vietnam Initiative for Energy Transition, an independent think tank focused on green energy policy. The United Nations human rights office this week raised concerns about the arrest."
Japan­ese sci­en­tists find mi­croplas­tics are present in clouds,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/japanese-scientists-find-microplastics-are-present-in-clouds,Japan­ese sci­en­tists have found be­tween 6.7 and 13.9 pieces of mi­croplas­tic in each litre of cloud wa­ter test­ed.,"Researchers in Japan have confirmed thatmicroplastics are present in clouds, where they are likely affecting the climate in ways that are not yet fully understood. In a study published in the journalEnvironmental Chemistry Letters, Japanese scientists climbed Mount Fuji and Mount Oyama in order to collect water from the mists that shroud the peaks, then applied advanced imaging techniques to the samples to determine their physical and chemical properties. The team identified nine different types of polymers and one type of rubber in the airborne microplastics, which ranged in size from 7.1 to 94.6 micrometres. Each litre (0.26 gallon) of cloud water tested contained between 6.7 to 13.9 pieces of the plastics. “If the issue of ‘plastic air pollution’ is not addressed proactively, climate change and ecological risks may become a reality, causing irreversible and serious environmental damage in the future,” lead author of the research, Hiroshi Okochi of Waseda University, warned in a statement on Wednesday. When microplastics reach the upper atmosphere and are exposed to ultraviolet radiation from sunlight, they degrade, contributing to greenhouse gasses, Okochi said.  Microplastics – which are defined as plastic particles under 5 millimetres that come from industrial effluent, textiles, synthetic car tires, personal care products and other sources – have already beendiscovered inside fish, peppering Arctic sea ice, and in the snows on the Pyrenees mountains between France and Spain.  However, the mechanisms of their transport to such varied locations had remained unclear, with research on airborne microplastic transport in particular being limited. “To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on airborne microplastics in cloud water,” the authors wrote in their paper. Waseda University said in a statement on Wednesday that research shows that “microplastics are ingested or inhaled by humans and animals alikeand have been detected in multiple organs such as lung, heart, blood, placenta, and faeces”. “Ten million tons of these plastic bits end up in the ocean, released with the ocean spray, and find their way into the atmosphere. This implies that microplastics may have become an essential component of clouds, contaminating nearly everything we eat and drink via ‘plastic rainfall’”, the university said in announcing the new research findings. Emerging evidence has linked microplastics to a range of effects on heart and lung health, as well as cancers, in addition to widespread environmental harm. "
Key take­aways from the sec­ond Re­pub­li­can US pres­i­den­tial de­bate,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/key-takeaways-from-the-second-republican-us-presidential-debate,Can­di­dates for 2024 nom­i­na­tion at­tack Trump for skip­ping the event as they talk im­mi­gra­tion and the econ­o­my.,"The seven candidates left in the campaign for the Republican 2024 presidential nomination spent their second somewhat chaotic debate attacking absent frontrunner Donald Trump and tussling over issues including immigration. The debate in the western state of California was another opportunity for Trump’s rivals to chip away at his massive lead among voters before the primary process kicks off in the state of Iowa in January. Seven candidatesmade the cut– Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. The 77-year-old Trump skipped the event for a second time – instead, travelling to Michigan to join striking autoworkers, a day after US President Joe Biden, who will run for a second term in 2024, joined the picket line. “They’re all job candidates,” Trump said dismissively of his rival Republicans. “Does anybody see any VP in the group? I don’t think so.” Here are the main takeaways from the second debate, which took place at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley. After months of avoiding direct confrontation, DeSantis appeared to have decided it was time to go on the offensive against Trump, who facesfour separate indictments– on election interference, allegations he mishandled secret government documents, and a hush money payment to an adult film star. It was 16 minutes before the Florida Governor got to speak – but when he did, he condemned the former president as “missing in action”. Sharpening his critique of the man whose endorsement he once embraced, DeSantis blamed Trump for adding trillions of dollars to the US national debt. “He should be on this stage tonight,” 45-year-old DeSantis said, drawing applause and some cheers from the audience at the event moderated by Fox Business and Univision. “He owes it to you to defend his record.” Less surprisingly, Christie, who has built his campaign around criticising Trump, also chimed in, looking directly into the camera to accuse the former president of being afraid. “You’re ducking these things, and let me tell you what’s going to happen. You keep doing that, no one up here is gonna call you Donald Trump any more. We’re gonna call you a Donald Duck,” he said, to a chorus of boos. Other candidates focused more on the former president’s platform and record in office. Pence, who was Trump’s vice president from 2017-2021, offered a mild critique of Trump’s desire to centralise power in the federal government, vowing to give power back to the states. While Haley said Trump had taken the wrong approach to China by focusing on trade, rather than broader security issues. A clip of Reagan, the US’s 40th president, calling for an “amnesty” for people in the US illegally was played ahead of a question on immigration policy. The candidates’ responses showed just how far to the right the Republican party has moved since. Christie, who once represented a Democratic state and backed a similar proposal a decade ago, distanced himself from Reagan’s call, saying it was effectively ancient history. “We’re no longer in a position to do that any more,” Christie said, stressing he would send the National Guard to the US-Mexico border “on Day One”. Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, went a step further, calling for an end to foreign aid to Latin America until the border was secured. “Only when we fix the immigration system, only when we make the border secure, should we ever put more money into this,” she said. Ramaswamy, meanwhile, also the son of Indian immigrants, jumped in to highlight his proposal to revoke US citizenship for children born in the country to parents in the US illegally. “If the kid of a Mexican diplomat doesn’t enjoy birthright citizenship, then neither does the kid of an illegal migrant who broke the law to come here,” the entrepreneur said. The entrepreneur and political novice had abreakout momentin the first debate, positioning himself as a Trump-like outsider and attacking his rivals as part of the establishment. Currently polling in third place, Ramaswamy appeared to take a more conciliatory approach this time around. “These are good people on this stage,” he declared at the start of the debate, and later repeatedly cited Reagan’s so-called “11th commandment” to never criticise another Republican. He still came under frequent attack from the other candidates, however. “Every time I hear you, I feel a little dumber,” Haley responded after Ramaswamy defended joining TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media site that has raised security concerns among US officials. Ramaswamy said he uses the app to connect with young voters. There were some cringeworthy moments as the candidates tried to land zinging retorts with the potential to go viral on social media. Pence was so eager to use his one-liner that he decided to deploy it in response to an earlier question about the United Auto Workers strike rather than the one he had actually been asked. “Joe Biden doesn’t belong on the picket line,” Pence joked. “He belongs on the unemployment line” There was no roar of laughter. Christie, meanwhile, took time off from bashing Trump to talk about the power of teachers’ unions, only to leave the audience squirming. Trying to suggest the influence of the unions on Biden’s White House, he declared the president was “sleeping with a member of the teachers union” apparently in reference to First Lady Jill Biden, who is a community college teacher and member of the National Education Association. Then, rather than avoiding the uncomfortable subject of private marital relations, Pence also dived into the issue. Given a chance to answer a question related to education, he referred to his own wife’s work as a teacher. “I gotta admit, I’ve been sleeping with a teacher for 38 years,” Pence said."
Calls for boy­cott af­ter al­leged as­sault mars Lebanon film fes­ti­val,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/calls-for-boycott-after-alleged-assault-mars-lebanon-film-festival,"LIFF mem­bers deny the at­tack, and lawyer rep­re­sent­ing fes­ti­val says a case will be filed against the ac­cuser.","The annual Lebanese Independent Film Festival (LIFF) in Beirut has been marred by allegations of an attack during one of its screenings that led to social media users branding it as a festival of “thuggery”. The event, which ran from Friday to Sunday, showcased dozens of films from local Lebanese filmmakers as well as from European directors, with support from the Canadian embassy. On Saturday, an attendee took to social media to complain about the poor organisation of the festival. Then, she says, her phone was taken away and she was physically assaulted by festival organisers. “People were walking in front of the screen in the middle of the movie, and chairs were being added in,” Farah Darwish said in a reel she posted on her Instagram page. After the screening, she says she was hanging out with her friends on the rooftop when a woman approached her and asked if she was the one who had complained about the organisation. She asked Darwish to follow her downstairs, where a man and another woman were waiting, and the three began arguing with Darwish. “They told me if I’m not satisfied with the organisation then I should leave. I replied that it’s my opinion, but then they took my phone and refused to give it to me, then they pulled my hair and started beating me,” Darwish said, trying to hold back tears. “Everyone was watching me getting beaten up inside and outside … Then everyone else came and started yelling at me, blaming me for what was happening, even though they were the ones hitting and attacking.” The co-director of LIFF, Dineta Williams-Trigg, issued a video statement, which she later deleted, in which she said she regretted the “unfortunate incident”. “On behalf of LIFF and our audience, I would like to apologise to our audience, to the guest, and to the station who was hosting us,” Williams-Trigg said. “I want to assure you that LIFF stands for independent artists by providing a platform for important stories to be shared with the world.” “Our intent was to speak to [Darwish] but unfortunately instead of a dialogue it escalated into a heated discussion,” she added. “We do not support any form of abuse to anyone anywhere, verbal or otherwise. I regret that calmness did not prevail.” The festival has faced a backlash from hundreds of Lebanese people on social media after thousands more viewed Darwish’s reel. Many are calling for a boycott of the festival and for Darwish to file an official police report. However, on Tuesday, a statement issued by a lawyer representing the LIFF said that a “woman” – appearing to reference Darwish – had caused the incident after she had been asked to leave for shouting. The statement also said that Darwish had attacked one of the organisers and that a law firm had been asked to file an official complaint against her for slander. One of the people accused of being involved, festival director Gauthier Read, told Al Jazeera on Tuesday that Darwish had “twist[ed] what actually happened, saying that we attacked her when in reality she hit one of our volunteers and knocked her to the ground”. He added that the LIFF had witnesses to corroborate the story. “This is clearly a smear campaign against us,” he said. “It’s a shame that some media outlets decided to go with [Darwish’s] version of the story without even reaching out to us to hear our side. Our sponsors and jury judges are all standing by our side.”"
Rus­sia says Ukraine’s West­ern al­lies as­sist­ed in Black Sea Fleet HQ at­tack,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/russia-says-ukraines-western-allies-assisted-in-black-sea-fleet-hq-attack,"Moscow says US, UK had role in plan­ning and ex­e­cut­ing at­tack by pro­vid­ing spy plane, satel­lite in­tel­li­gence to Kyiv.","Russia accused Ukraine’s Western allies of helping plan and execute a missile attack on the Russian Black Sea fleet’s headquarters inthe annexed Crimean Peninsula last week. Moscow’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday that Western reconnaissance data, NATO country satellites and spy planes were all used in the attack carried out by Ukraine on the fleet’s headquarters. “There is no doubt that the attack had been planned in advance using Western intelligence means, NATO satellite assets and reconnaissance planes and was implemented upon the advice of [United States] and British security agencies and in close coordination with them,” Zakharova said at a briefing. “The obvious aim of such terrorist acts is to divert attention from the failed attempts of the counteroffensive by the Ukrainian armed forces and to frighten people, to stir up panic in our society,” she said. Moscow has repeatedly claimed that the US and its NATO allies have become involved in the war in Ukraine by supplying weapons to Kyiv and providing Ukrainian forces with intelligence information and helping plan attacks on Russian facilities. Unconfirmed news reports said Storm Shadow missiles, which have been provided to Ukraine by the United Kingdom and France, were used in the missile attack onthe fleet’s headquarters in Sevastopol on Friday.  Zakharova’s criticism of the West followed comments made on Tuesday by Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, who said the arrival this week of US-made Abrams battle tanks in Ukraine and a promise by Washington to supply Kyiv withan unspecified number of long-range ATACMS missiles, would push NATO closer to a direct conflict with Russia. Friday’s missile attack on the Black Sea fleet’s headquarters in Sevastopol was just the latest against targets in the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Crimea has served as the key hub supporting the invasion of Ukraine and has increasingly come under fire by Ukrainian forces, who have promised to see the peninsula returned under Kyiv’s control. Ukraine said the missile strike put a large hole in the main building of the fleet’s headquarters and that 34 officers were killed, including the fleet’s commander Admiral Viktor Sokolov, and more than 100 Russian personnel were wounded. However,Sokolov was seen participating in a Russian defenceofficials’ meeting on Tuesday that was broadcast by Russian media.  On Wednesday, Russian state television stations also showed Sokolov purportedly speaking to journalists in Sevastopol after handing awards to a Black Sea fleet football team. Washington, DC-based think tank,the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), said on Wednesday that while Russian media were at pains to “publish inconclusive ‘proof’” that the Black Sea fleet commander is still alive, the institute would reserve judgement until more is known. “ISW is unprepared at this time to make an assessment about the authenticity of the footage or the date of its filming,”the think tank said. “The Kremlin and Russian Ministry of Defense have been notably silent on the matter and have not directly confirmed that Sokolov is alive,” it added. Ukraine’s Special Operation Forces posted a statement on Tuesday saying its sources had claimed that Sokolov was among the dead from the missile strike and that it was trying to verify those reports after the video of Sokolov surfaced.

Chi­na is­sues warn­ing for mil­i­tary ex­er­cis­es in parts of South Chi­na Sea,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/china-issues-warning-for-military-exercises-in-parts-of-south-china-sea,No­tice to ship­ping comes amid ris­ing ten­sion be­tween Bei­jing and Mani­la over dis­put­ed Scar­bor­ough Shoal.,"Chinese authorities have issued a navigation warning over planned military exercises in some parts of the South China Sea. The Guangdong Maritime Safety Administration said the warning would be in place from 6am (22:00 GMT to 11:30am (03:30 GMT) and from 6pm (10:00 GMT) to 9:30pm (13:30 GMT) on September 28. “Military exercises will be conducted in some waters of the South China Sea and navigation is prohibited,” state broadcaster CCTV reported. It did not elaborate on the location of the exercises. China claims almost the entire South China Sea under its controversial nine-dash line. In recent months,tensionshave risen with the Philippines, whose claims overlap with China’s, over the Second Thomas Shoal and Scarborough Shoal. Both are within Manila’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), defined under the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as generally extending 200 nautical miles (about 370km) from shore, within which the coastal state has the exclusive right to explore and exploit. Earlier this week, the Philippines coastguard cut a 300 metre floating barrier installed by China that it said was blocking fishing boats’ access to Scarborough Shoal, which Beijing seized from Manila after a months-long standoff in 2012. Late on Wednesday, the Chinese coastguard disputed that version of the events, saying the barrier had been deployed on Friday when a Philippine vessel entered the area “illegally” and was removed the following day. “I would also like to reiterate once again. Huangyan Island is China’s inherent territory,” Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson at the Chinese Foreign Ministry, claimed at a regular press briefing, referring to Scarborough Shoal by its Chinese name. Manila refers to it as Bajo de Masinloc. The rocky outcrop is a prime fishing spot and has been a site of contention for years. Both countries claim sovereignty over the shoal, which lies about 120 nautical miles (about 222km) from the Philippine island of Luzon, and 594 nautical miles (about 1,100km) from China’s southern island of Hainan. China has maintained a coast guard presence there ever since the2012 standoff. Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam also claim parts of the sea near their coast and have reported incidents of harassment by Chinese ships. In a separate report early on Thursday, China’s state media also reported several bombers from the Southern Theater Air Force, which covers the South China Sea, held night-time exercises on Wednesday. The report did not elaborate on exactly where the exercises took place."
Czech gov’t plans to buy 24 F-35 stealth fight­ers in $6.5bn de­fence spend,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/czech-govt-plans-to-buy-24-f-35-stealth-fighters-in-6-5bn-defence-spend,Czech PM Petr Fi­ala says pur­chase of US-made F-35 fight­er jets tells mil­i­tary al­lies ‘that they can count on us’.,"The Czech government has approved a plan to buy 24 US-made F-35 advanced fighter jets in a deal valued at approximately $6.5bn, the largest defence contract ever signed by the Czech Republic that will see the country significantlyboost its military capabilities and integration with NATO. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala told reporters on Wednesday that the first of the supersonic stealth fighters would arrive by 2031 and the country’s military would have all 24 planes at its disposal by 2035. “The first F-35s will be ready in 2029 and our pilots will start training with them in the United States then,” Fiala said. Fiala said the F-35s “will solve the future of our tactical air forces for dozens of years to come”. “For our defence, it is important to boost our ties with NATO allies,” he said. In acquiring F-35s, “we are telling our allies that we take the defence of our country seriously and that they can count on us”, he said in a statement on social media.  “In comparing the capabilities of the aircraft and their service life with the price, there is no better solution for fulfilling the tasks of the tactical air force of the Army of the Czech Republic for the next decades,” he added. State broadcaster Radio Prague International said the purchase of the F-35s “will be the biggest defence contract ever signed by [The Czech Republic]”. The US State Department approved the sale of F-35 jets, munitions and related equipment to the Czech Republic in June amid the country’s plans to replace 14 leased JAS-39 Gripen fighter jets from Sweden that are currently used by the Czech army. Czech Defence Minister Jana Cernochova said the state will pay 150 billion Czech crowns ($6.47bn) for the aircraft by 2034, a bill that includes the cost of the aircraft, training of pilots, ammunition, upgrades to the Caslav air force base in central Czech Republic and fuel. A member of the European Union and NATO with a population of some 10.5 million people, theCzech Republic has provided substantial military aid to Ukrainesince Russia’s invasion, including aircraft, tanks, howitzer artillery, armoured vehicles and ammunition.  In exchange for its military aid to Kyiv, Prague has received German-made Leopard tanks and financial compensation from the US and the EU. Chief of the general staff of the Czech armed forces Lieutenant General Karel Rehka said that the new jets would ensure “that in the case of need, we’ll manage to effectively defend ourselves against aggression, together with our allies”. The announcement of the F-35 deal comes as theCzech government plans to spend two percentof its gross domestic product on defence, in line with its NATO pledge. Produced by Lockheed Martin and equipped with anti-detection stealth technology, F-35s are used across NATO, but also by Australia, Japan, Israel and South Korea. Other countries including neutral Switzerland have also signed deals to buy the planes, which were launched in 2006.  The US government’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in June that the F-35s would “improve the Czech Republic’s defence capabilities as well as support NATO operations by guarding against modern threats and maintaining a constant presence in the region”. The Czech army recently bought US-made Viper combat helicopters and Venom multi-purpose helicopters, replacing obsolete Russian-made Mi-24 helicopters, some of which it has sent to Ukraine."

Burkina Faso’s military rulers said in a statement on Wednesday that army officers and others had planned to seize power and plunge the country into “chaos”. “Officers and other alleged actors involved in this attempt at destabilisation have been arrested and others are actively sought,” a spokesman for the ruling military Rimtalba Jean Emmanuel Ouedraogo said in a statement without providing details. The latest coupattempt occurred on Tuesday, according to the statement. The military government said it would seek to shed “all possible light on this plot” and that it regretted “that officers whose oath is to defend their homeland have strayed into an undertaking of this nature”. The country’s military prosecutor later said that four people had been arrested and two were on the run. An investigation has been opened based on “credible allegations about a plot against state security implicating officers”, the prosecutor said.  Earlier this month, the military prosecutor said three soldiers had been arrested and charged with plotting against the ruling military government ofCaptain Ibrahim Traore who seized power in September 2022eight months after an earlier military coup had overthrown the democratically elected President Roch Marc Kabore. Burkina Faso’s capital city Ouagadougou appeared calm on Wednesday evening following the military’s announcement of an attempt to topple it.  Thousands of pro-military government demonstrators took to the streets of Ouagadougou and elsewhere on Tuesday to show their support for the country’s military rulers following a call from Traore supporters to “defend” him amid rumours of a mutiny circulated on social media. On Monday,French news magazine Jeune Afrique was suspendedfrom publishing what the military said was an “untruthful” article that reported tension and discontent within the armed forces. One of a growing number of West African countries where the military has seized power, army officers in Burkina Faso have taken control amidpublic discontent as armed groups linked to al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS)have launched a rebellion that has destabilised the country and its neighbours in West Africa’s Sahel region.   More than two million people have been uprooted by the fighting in Burkina Faso, making it one of the worst internal displacement crises in Africa. Last week authorities claimed nearly 192,000 internally displaced people had returned to their homes after various regions were retaken by government forces, though rebel attacks continue unabated despite claims of the military winning back territory. More than 50 Burkinabe soldiers and volunteer fighterswere killed in clashes with rebels in early September – the heaviest losses in months – the latest deaths that add to the thousands of civilians and troops that have died in rebel attacks in recent years, according to organisations monitoring the conflict."

North Ko­re­an par­lia­ment en­shrines nu­clear am­bi­tions in con­sti­tu­tion,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/north-korean-parliament-enshrines-nuclear-ambitions-in-constitution,Leader Kim Jong Un says the con­sti­tu­tion­al amend­ment will help North Ko­rea hold a ‘def­i­nite edge’ in de­ter­ring threats.,"North Korea’s parliament has unanimously moved to enshrine its nuclear programme in the country’s constitution. The state news agency KCNA reported on the “crucial agenda item” early on Thursday, explaining that the new constitutional amendment would establish North Korea’s pursuit of a nuclear force “as the basic law of the state”. The news follows a meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday of the Supreme People’s Assembly, North Korea’s rubber-stamp legislature. The country’s leader, Kim Jong Un, addressed the assembly to support the passage of the amendment. Kim called to “accelerate the modernisation of nuclear weapons in order to hold the definite edge of strategic deterrence” against perceived threats, like the United States and South Korea. “This is a historic event that provided a powerful political lever for remarkably strengthening the national defence capabilities,” Kim said, according to the KCNA. “The [North Korean] nuclear force-building policy has been made permanent as the basic law of the state, which no one is allowed to flout with anything.”  Just days prior, North Korean Ambassador Kim Song warned the United Nations General Assembly that his country could be pushed to nuclear war by “hostile threats from outside”. “The Korean peninsula is in a hair-trigger situation with imminent danger of nuclear war breakout,” Ambassador Kim said on Tuesday. Citing “extremely dangerous” conditions, he added that North Korea “is urgently required to further accelerate the build-up of its self-defence capabilities to defend itself impregnably”. The announcement that nuclear weapons would be enshrined in the country’s constitution comes in defiance of multiple UN Security Council sanctions, meant to deter North Korea from pursuing nuclear arms. Over the past year, North Korea has been escalating the number of weapons tests it conducts, launching an array of ballistic and cruise missiles. Since 2006, it has also conducted six nuclear tests, though the last one took place in 2017. US officials, including National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, have sounded the alarm over the possibility that a seventh test could be on the horizon. “He will uncork that at a time and place of his choosing, which is something we’ll be watching for very, very carefully,” Lieutenant General Scott Berrier, the director of the US Defense Intelligence Agency, said in March. Berrier at the time warned that North Korea has become “much more dangerous” as it expands its arsenal of missiles and nuclear weapons. In January 2022, for example, the country announced its first successful test of ahypersonic missile, a weapon that can surpass the speed of sound. In April, it successfully launched its firstsolid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile(ICBM), an advancement over liquid-fuel versions, which are slower to launch and harder to use. “He continues to pursue greater accuracy and lethality with his with his missile force,” Berrier said. But North Korean officials have framed the nuclear build-up as necessary to repel threats from the US, South Korea and Japan, an alliance leader Kim Jong Un has compared to an “Asian-version NATO”. The three countries have conducted regular joint military exercises in the Pacific region, an act that North Korean state media has termed “nuclear blackmail”. Earlier this month, Kim madea rare tripoutside of his country, visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Vostochny spaceport to bolster ties and inspectRussian military capabilities. Putinpledged to visitNorth Korea in return, raising concerns about an arms trade deal between the two countries."
"Trump vis­its Michi­gan au­towork­ers a day af­ter Biden, ramp­ing up 2024 race",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/trump-visits-michigan-autoworkers-a-day-after-biden-ramping-up-2024-race,Back-to-back vis­its un­der­score sig­nif­i­cance of work­ing-class vote in key states dur­ing the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.,"Former United States President Donald Trump has travelled to Michigan to court striking auto-workers, just one day after President Joe Bidenwalked the picket linein Detroit to show support for their labour union. The back-to-back visits underscore the significance of so-called Rust Belt battleground states in the 2024 presidential election, which is shaping up to be a second showdown between Biden and Trump. Ahead of his visit on Wednesday, Trump expressed a desire to “save” autoworkers in the Rust Belt, a historic hub for American manufacturing that stretches from the midwest to the northeast. “Heading to Michigan now. I LOVE, & WILL SAVE THE AUTOWORKERS. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social. His prime-time address at a Detroit auto-parts supplier is roughly set to coincide with thesecond Republican presidential debate, scheduled for 9pm Eastern Time (01:00 GMT Thursday) in California. It will be the second time Trump has chosen to skip a televised primary debate in the 2024 race, a decision he attributes to his already commanding lead among Republican voters. Voters in Michigan and other Rust Belt states are seen as the key to victory for both Biden and Trump, if he indeed becomes the Republican party nominee in the November 2024 election. In 2016, Trump’s surprise sweep of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — all considered part of the Rust Belt — delivered him the presidency over his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. His victories in those states were seen as tapping into the disillusionment of residents who had seen industries scale back their presence — or disappear — in recent decades. The manufacturing decline has been accompanied by the waning influence of reliably Democratic-voting unions.   Biden, meanwhile, reclaimed Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin for the Democrats in the 2020 presidential race, campaigning on his staunch support for organised labour and his roots in Scranton, Pennsylvania. As he seeks reelection in 2024, Biden returned to Michigan on Tuesday, where he became the first sitting US president in recent history to join striking workers on a picket line. Flanked by United Auto Workers (UAW) leaders at an auto plant west of Detroit, Biden used a megaphone to call for a “significant raise” for employees. The UAW launched its partial,coordinated strikeearlier this month in a push for wage increases, shorter hours and improved retirement benefits. Workers across 20 states have since walked off the job as part of the strike. Trump, meanwhile, has sought to portray Biden’s policies — and the persistently high inflation in the US — as damaging to workers. He particularly seized upon Biden’s support for electric vehicles, saying an industry shift towards the lower emission vehicles would undercut segments of the traditional automotive industry. “Joe Biden’s draconian and indefensible electric vehicle mandate will annihilate the US auto industry and cost countless thousands of autoworkers their jobs,” Trump said in a statement on Tuesday.  The Biden administration hasmaintainedthat the shift to electric vehicles will create high-paying union jobs, and his administration has unveiled billions in grants and loans to support the transition. Still, the issue remains divisive for autoworkers. On Wednesday, Trump is set to speak at 8:15pm Eastern (00:15 GMT Thursday) at Drake Enterprises, a non-unionised auto parts supplier in Clinton Township in Michigan that makes automotive and heavy-duty truck components for semi-trucks. The company’s president, Nathan Stemple, has said the company would be hurt by a shift to electric vehicles. Several hundred current and former UAW members, as well as members of plumbers and pipefitters unions, are expected to attend the speech. While the UAW has not yet endorsed Biden for 2024, the union previously supported his 2020 campaign. UAW President Shawn Fain spoke alongside the president on Tuesday. He remains deeply critical of Trump, Biden’s rival in the 2020 race. “I don’t think he cares about working-class people,” Fain said when asked about Trump’s upcoming visit. “I think he cares about the billionaire class, he cares about the corporate interests. I think he’s just trying to pander to people and say what they want to hear, and it’s a shame.” The UAW represents an important union voting bloc. It has about 400,000 active members and more than 580,000 retired members in the US and Canada."
Meta aims to build a fu­ture to con­nect ‘phys­i­cal and dig­i­tal’,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/9/27/meta-aims-to-build-a-future-to-connect-physical-and-digital,Meta un­veiled new AI prod­ucts for con­sumers as well as bots and an up­dat­ed vir­tu­al-re­al­i­ty head­set.,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg kicked off the tech giant’s Connect developer conference on Wednesday with new AI products for consumers, including smart glasses that can answer questions and stream directly on Facebook, as well as bots that create photo-realistic images and an updated virtual-reality headset. Standing in a courtyard at his company’s Menlo Park, California, headquarters, Zuckerberg told the audience of developers, employees and journalists that Meta is “focused on building the future of human connection” – and painted a near-future where people interact with hologram versions of their friends or coworkers and with AI bots built to assist them. Zuckerberg described the products as bringing together virtual and real worlds and underscored that part of what Meta offered was low-cost or free AI that could be integrated into daily routines. “Soon the physical and digital will come together in what we call the ‘metaverse’,” he said. The company unveiled the next version of its virtual-reality headset, the Quest 3. It will cost $499 and begin shipping on October 10. Zuckerberg also introduced an AI personal assistant that people can interact with using any of Meta’s messaging apps – along with a smattering of AI characters he called “a bit more fun”, such as “Max the sous chef”, who can help come up with ideas for dinner, or Lily, a “personal editor and writing partner”. “These are just a few we have trained. There are a lot more coming,” he said. He also introduced the next version of Meta’s Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses, which let people record videos or take photos, livestream, listen to music and interact with the Meta AI assistant. “Smart glasses are the ideal form factor for you to let an AI assistant see what you are seeing and hear what you are hearing,” Zuckerberg said. The glasses will launch on October 17 and cost $299. Meta is in the midst of a corporate transformation that it says will take years to complete. It wants to evolve from a provider of social platforms to a dominant power in a nascent virtual-reality world called the metaverse – sort of like the internet brought to life, or at least rendered in 3D. But this transformation has been slower than expected – and has already cost billions of dollars – and Meta’s main business remains advertising on its social media platforms, Facebook and Instagram. Competition with TikTok remains Meta’s biggest challenge, said Insider Intelligence analyst Yoram Wurmser. “A lot of this effort around chatbots and stories and other ways just to keep engagement going [like] AI-driven personalisation and stuff like that, that’s the overarching challenge for the company,” he said. Squeezed by a slump in online advertising and uncertainty around the global economy, Meta hascut more than 20,000 jobssince last November. Zuckerberg dubbed 2023 the company’s “year of efficiency” as it reduces its workforce while focusing on more technical hires such as experts in AI to focus on Meta’s long-term vision. Artificial intelligence is central to that vision. In July, Meta released the next generation of its AI large language model and made the technology, known as Llama 2, free for research and commercial use. On Wednesday, it unveiled an AI image generator named Emu, which creates images based on prompts from users. Much like tech peers Google and Microsoft, Meta has long had a big research team of computer scientists devoted to advancing AI technology. But it has been overshadowed as the release ofChatGPTsparked a rush to profit off of “generative AI” tools that can create new prose, images and other media. Zuckerberg said at the time that people can download its new AI models directly or through a partnership that makes them available on Microsoft’s cloud platform Azure “along with Microsoft’s safety and content tools”."
French am­bas­sador to Niger re­turns to Paris,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/french-ambassador-to-niger-returns-to-paris,Syl­vain Itte leaves Niger af­ter amid de­mands from the new mil­i­tary lead­ers who took over in a coup on July 26.,"France’s ambassador to Niger has landed in Parisafter weeks of tensionswith the new military government in the West African country that demanded his expulsion following the overthrow of democratically-elected leader President Mohamed Bazoum. French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna met Sylvain Itte “to thank him and his teams for his work in the service of our country under difficult conditions”, the ministry said in a written statement to AFP news agency. Itte left Niamey with six colleagues “around 4am” (03:00 GMT), a diplomatic source had earlier told AFP. On Sunday, French President Emmanuel Macron had announced in a TV interview that the ambassador would leave “in the coming hours”.   Niger’s military leaders – who had told Itte to leave the country after they overthrew Bazoum on July 26 and took away the envoy’s diplomatic immunity and visa – welcomed the announcement. However, despite a 48-hour ultimatum for him to go back to France that was issued in August, he remained as Paris refused to comply or recognise the new military leaders. Paris had said that only Bazoum’s deposed government could order the envoy out. Earlier this month, Macron said Itte was living like a hostage in the French embassy and accused military rulers of blocking food deliveries to the mission. Born in the Malian capital Bamako in 1959, Itte had been in the post as ambassador to Niger for a year. He was previously ambassador to Uruguay and Angola. Separately on Wednesday, Macron’s office reiterated France’s support for ousted President Bazoum. He had told Hassoumi Massaoudou, foreign minister in the overthrown government, that France would continue to work “for a return to the constitutional order in Niger”, the Elysee Palace said. Macron in aTV interviewon Sunday – in addition to announcing Ambassador Itte would depart – said French troops would withdraw from Niger in “the months and weeks to come” with a full pullout “by the end of the year”, another demand of the Niger regime. In the interview, the French president also said military cooperation between the two nations was “over”. In Niamey, thousands of people have been holding near-daily demonstrations around a military base housing French soldiers to demand their departure. France has about 1,500 soldiers in the country as part of a wider fight against groups linked to al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS). The coup against Bazoum was the third such coup in the region in as many years, following similar actions in fellow former French colonies Mali and Burkina Faso in 2021 and 2022, respectively. The earlier coups also forced the pullouts of French troops."
US sol­dier’s re­lease from North Ko­rea: What you need to know in 500 words,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/us-soldier-travis-kings-release-from-north-korea-what-you-need-to-know,Wash­ing­ton says re­turn of US army Pri­vate Travis King does not sig­nal diplo­mat­ic break­through with Py­ongyang.,"Washington, DC –After more than two months in North Korean custody, Americansoldier Travis Kingis returning to the United States, ending a saga that risked further inflaming tensions between Washington and Pyongyang. US officials on Wednesday thanked Sweden and China for facilitating King’s release, but stressed that the move does not represent a diplomatic breakthrough with North Korea. King spent weeks in jail in South Korea for assault earlier this year before hecrossed the borderinto North Korea in July. Here’s what you need to know. King, a 23-year-old army private from southeast Wisconsin, joined the US military in 2021. Speaking to US media outlets, family members previously described him as nice and quiet. But relatives told The Associated Press earlier this year that his mental health took a turn after the death of his seven-year-old cousin in February.  King was supposed to fly home from Seoul to Texas after his release from prison in July. But he left the airport and, days later, he joined a civilian tourist group in the South Korean border village of Panmunjom. On July 18, he raninto North Koreaacross the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two countries. North Korea said through its official KCNA news agency on Wednesday that it “decided to expel” King, who is Black, after concluding an investigation over his entry into the country. “King confessed that he illegally intruded into the territory of [North Korea] as he harboured ill feelings against inhuman maltreatment andracial discriminationwithin the US army and was disillusioned about the unequal US society,” the KCNA report said. Nothing, according to US officials. “We made no concessions as part of securing his return,” US Department of State Matthew Miller told reporters on Wednesday.  Miller said King was transported across the border from North Korea to the Chinese city of Dandon, where he was met by US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns. From there, he boarded a State Department plane to Shenyang, China and was subsequently transferred to a US air base south of Seoul. By Wednesday afternoon, he was en route to the US. That is unclear. The Pentagon could take disciplinary action and/or pursue criminal charges against King. So far, it has not made any announcements to that effect. Not necessarily. Miller said Washington favours diplomacy with Pyongyang, but King’s release does not signal a rapprochement. There has been a recent spike in tensions amid increased military drills between the US, South Korea and Japan, as well as North Koreanmissile testing. The US has also warned North Koreaagainst sellingweapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine. “I would not see this as a sign of some breakthrough. I think it’s a one-off,” Miller said of King’s release."
Trudeau apol­o­gis­es af­ter Nazi ho­n­oured in Cana­da’s par­lia­ment,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/trudeau-apologises-after-nazi-honoured-in-canadas-parliament,Cana­di­an prime min­is­ter says ‘ter­ri­ble mis­take’ vi­o­lat­ed mem­o­ry of all who suf­fered un­der Nazi regime.,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has apologised after a man who served in a Nazi unit during World War II was honoured in Parliament, saying the “terrible mistake” harmed the memory of all those who suffered during the Holocaust. “On behalf of all those who were present in this chamber, I would like to offer my most sincere apologies for what happened on Friday,” Trudeau said in French in the House of Commons on Wednesday afternoon. “Paying tribute to this individual, without knowing who he was, was a terrible mistake and a violation of the memory of those who cruelly suffered at the hands of the Nazi regime.” Yaroslav Hunka, 98, received two standing ovations in the House last week during a special session attended byUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was in Ottawa to appeal for Canada’s continued support against Russia’s military offensive. Jewish community groupslater reportedthat Hunka served in the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Nazi military unit during World War II, and they called for an explanation and an apology.  Trudeau on Wednesday also apologised to Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian delegation that travelled to Canada to take part in the parliamentary session, saying the incident has fuelled Russian “propaganda”. “It is extremely troubling to think that this egregious error is being politicised by Russia and its supporters to provide false propaganda about what Ukraine is fighting for,” the prime minister told reporters during a news conference before he spoke in Parliament. Russia, which launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine last year, has described the decision to honour Hunka as “outrageous”. “Many Western countries, including Canada, have raised a young generation that does not know who fought whom or what happened during the Second World War. And they know nothing about the threat of fascism,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov previously said. The Russian authorities have justified their continued assault on Ukraine as part of a push to “de-Nazify” the country. Kyiv and its allies have dismissed that, accusing Moscow of trying to conduct a land grab. Trudeau’s office and senior members of his Liberal Party government have said they had no advance knowledge of Hunka’s invitation to Parliament. The prime minister reiterated on Wednesday that the speaker of the House of Commons, Anthony Rota, was “solely responsible” for his recognition. “All of us who were in this House on Friday regret deeply having stood and clapped, even though we did so unaware of the context,” Trudeau said. Rotaannounced his resignationearlier this week — which he said would come into effect at the end of Wednesday — amid mounting pressure to step down over the incident. “I reiterate my profound regret for my error in recognising an individual in the House,” the speaker said on Tuesday. Still, Trudeau — who hasseen his popularity dropin recent months — continues to be hammered by his political opponents, with the head of the opposition Conservative Party, Pierre Poilievre, accusing the prime minister of failing to adequately vet Hunka. “This is by far the biggest hit Canada’s diplomatic reputation has ever taken in its history, and it happened under Justin Trudeau’s government,” Poilievresaidearlier on Wednesday. Jagmeet Singh, leader of the progressive New Democratic Party (NDP), also said that “real damage has been done — real damage to the Jewish community, real damage to the war effort in Ukraine and real damage to Canada’s reputation”. “What is [Trudeau] going to do in concrete terms to clean up this mess?” Singh asked in the House of Commons."
‘State of emer­gency’: Six Pales­tin­ian cit­i­zens of Is­rael killed in one day,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/state-of-emergency-six-palestinian-citizens-of-israel-killed-in-one-day,Pales­tini­ans and ad­vo­ca­cy groups say Is­raeli au­thor­i­ties have long turned a blind eye to crime in their com­mu­ni­ties.,"Six Palestinian citizens of Israel have been killed in two separate shootings, police said, the latest fatalities in a crime wave hitting the country’s Palestinian minority. Five members of the same family were killed on Wednesday in a shooting in northern Israel. The three men and two women were shot dead in broad daylight in the town of Basmat Tabun, northwest of Nazareth, police said in a statement. The Abraham Initiatives, a Jewish-Arab advocacy and monitoring group in Israel, identified the victims as a couple and their three adult children. Police said they were treating the incident as criminal and hunting down suspected assailants. Earlier on Wednesday, masked gunmen ambushed and killed another Palestinian citizen of Israel, who was on his way to work in the nearby coastal city of Haifa. Police said they were investigating whether the two shootings were connected. Authorities in al-Halisa, the Haifa neighbourhood where Wednesday’s first killing took place, shuttered all schools and asked that students study from home for at least another day. Wednesday’s fatalities brought the number of Palestinian citizens of Israel killed so far this year to 188, according to the Abraham Initiatives. Palestinians have long voiced anger at what they have said is a deliberatelack of policingin their towns and neighbourhoods – giving criminals and drug dealers free rein. Palestinian citizens of Israel comprise about 20 percent of the country’s 9.7 million population. They have also long suffered frompoverty, discrimination and neglect by the government. The country’s far-right national security minister,Itamar Ben-Gvir, promised to crack down on crime in Israel’s Palestinian communities when he took office late last year. But Ben-Gvir,known as an anti-Palestinian provocateur, has seemingly done little to bring safety to Palestinian towns and villages. The violence has instead intensified, with more than double the number of such homicides taking place for similar periods in recent years. Less than 10 percent of similar cases have been solved this year, the Abraham Initiatives group added, describing the surge in violence as a symptom of both police indifference and Palestinian distrust of the police. “The prime minister must sack the minister of public security and immediately put in place a plan to address criminality in the Arab society. It’s a state of emergency,” the Abraham Initiatives said in a statement. “Police do not have the willingness or the capacity,” said Thabet Abu Rass, the group’s director. “People are afraid to go outside. It’s a very dangerous situation right now.” "
In­dige­nous peo­ple march on Bo­go­ta to de­mand jus­tice for killings,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/indigenous-people-march-on-bogota-to-demand-justice-for-killings,In­dige­nous ‘Min­ga’ col­lec­tive urges ac­tion to stem a ris­ing wave of vi­o­lence in their com­mu­ni­ties across Colom­bia.,"Bogota, Colombia –Thousands of Indigenous protesters have converged on Tercer Milenio Park in the heart of the Colombian capital, with music playing and smoke from campfires wafting through the air. Members of the so-called “Minga” – a collective movement of Indigenous peoples – have organised protests in Bogota many times before, but this is their first demonstration during the administration of left-wingPresident Gustavo Petro. This week, they travelled with a simple – albeit pressing – demand: end an ongoing wave of violence that has disproportionately affected Indigenous people in Colombia, whose communities stretch across nearly every region, from Narino to Amazonia. Ahead of the main protest march on Wednesday, demonstrator Viviana Guerrera said while she supported Petro in last year’s elections, she felt “extremely disappointed” by a lack of progress in curtailing violence in her home region of Cauca, which has long been afocal point of conflict. “Every government needs to be held accountable,” Guerrera, a member of the Nasa Indigenous community, told Al Jazeera from the park, where organisers on Tuesday estimated that more than 12,000 people had already gathered. “This government is no exception.”  Petro, who took office in August 2022, has promised to pursue what he calls “total peace” in a country that is still grappling with the effects of nearly six decades of internal armed conflict. His plan, which involves both military action and direct negotiations with criminal armed groups, has so far yielded mixed results. A six-month ceasefire with the largest remaining rebel group in Colombia, the National Liberation Army (ELN), which wascelebrated as a political victoryin August, has so far held. But a number of informal ceasefires with other armed groups this year have since collapsed, and violence in rural areas has largely continued unabated. The Global Witness advocacy group recently designated Colombia as the most dangerous country in the world for land defenders and environmental activists last year – and a disproportionate number of those targeted leaders come from Indigenous communities. According tostatisticsfrom the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), more than 37,000 people across the country were affected by violence between January and September of this year. More than 43,000 others also were displaced by threats from armed groups or open fighting, the UN agency found. Colombian human rights watchdog Indepaz puts the displacement figure at more thantwice that. However, both organisations agree that Indigenous communities make up roughly half of all those displaced or affected by the violence, despite representing just 3.5 percent of the population. The Regional Indigenous Council of Cauca (CRIC), one of the groups that organised the Minga, has called for an “Indigenous, social and popular struggle” against what it described as a “constant violation of human rights” and the killings of Indigenous and social leaders. “We have come to work, in a grand assembly, to support this government in ‘total peace’ and form a pact to stop war and bloodshed,” Joe Sauco, a senior representative of the CRIC, said during a news conference on Tuesday. “We want to support a way out of this tragic situation that rejects violence.” The mood in Tercer Milenio Park has been festive, with children running through the area. Members of Colombia’sIndigenous Guard, an unarmed security force that often confronts armed groups operating near Indigenous communities, also stood watch at the main entrance in the middle of downtown Bogota on Tuesday. The march on Wednesday is set to coincide with street demonstrations called by Petro in support of a number of his reform bills, which have largely stalled in Congress. Some leaders at the Minga publicly called for support for the president’s administration. But Eduardo Rojas, who travelled 14 hours by bus from Amazonia to participate in the rally, denounced what he said were false promises from Petro. “We elected this government,” he told Al Jazeera, referring to the overwhelming support Petro’s presidential campaign enjoyed amongst Indigenous voters. “But what we were sold, and the reality of what we got, are two very different things.” Rojas said his community in the region of central Amazonia has seen little progress in halting attacks from criminal armed groups, which he said forcibly recruit members and commit extortion and sexual violence. Still, he said the Minga’s reception in the capital this year was different from past editions. “I have attended dozens of Mingas since my first as a young man in 1971,” he said. “And we were often perceived as invaders by the national government. “As always, this time we have come in peace. I feel that this government knows that.”  Elizabeth Dickinson, a senior Andes analyst at the International Crisis Group think-tank, said the frustrations expressed by Rojas are far from uncommon among Indigenous people in Colombia. She attributed it, in part, to a lack of communication between the federal government and civil society. “The way that ‘total peace’has been rolled outhas been very top down,” Dickinson told Al Jazeera. “And in some ways this hasn’t had much direct impact on rural communities. Implementing security programmes in these regions is also a huge logistical and social challenge.” Dickinson also said that there have been missteps. “It was a strategic mistake for the government to grant broad ceasefires earlier this year without serious concessions from armed groups,” she said. “And criminal organisations took advantage of this by digging in and fortifying their presence rather than disarming.” Nonetheless, for Rojas, this week’s march is a chance to focus public attention in Colombia on the violence faced by Indigenous communities. “The government must deliver what it promised,” he said. “And I will keep attending Mingas until they do.”"
Google’s an­titrust show­down with US could ‘dra­mat­i­cal­ly change’ com­pe­ti­tion,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/9/27/googles-antitrust-showdown-with-us-could-dramatically-change-competition,"The case could also im­pact how new tech­nolo­gies like AI are mar­ket­ed to con­sumers, ex­perts said.","A landmark trial currently under way in Washington may well decide the future of the internet. In the dock is Google, the world’s largest search engine. The United States Department of Justice has accused the search giant of muscling its way to dominance by paying other companies like Apple to be the default search engine on their devices. “Google pays billions of dollars each year to distributors — including popular-device manufacturers such as Apple, LG, Motorola, and Samsung … to secure default status for its general search engine,” the Justice Department’s complaint says. This, the DOJ thinks, chokes off competition that includes other search engines like Microsoft’s Bing, and privately held DuckDuckGo. Google, meanwhile, has argued that its dominant market share — which some estimates peg at 90 percent — is because its product is superior, not because it pays other companies to be the default option. “People don’t use Google because they have to — they use it because they want to,” wrote Kent Walker, Google’s president of global affairs, in ablog postpublished days before the trial began. “Making it easier for people to get the products they want benefits consumers and is supported by American antitrust law.” The outcome of the trial is not expected until early next year, and the result will almost certainly be appealed by either party. But whatever happens might fundamentally change the way Google and other Big Tech companies function. “This is the biggest antitrust suit related to a tech giant in decades. It could dramatically change competition relating to the technology involved in internet searches,” Eric Chaffee, a law professor at the Case Western Reserve University, told Al Jazeera.  “It also could impact how new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, emerge and are marketed to consumers.” The Google case is one of the handful of antitrust battles playing out in the US as government agencies try to rein in some of the unprecedented power that Big Tech has amassed over the last decade. On Tuesday, the US Federal Trade Commission and 17 statessued Amazon, accusing the e-commerce giant of using its monopoly position to force merchants selling on its platform to buy extraneous services, and inflating pricing for consumers across the web by forcing sellers to list their products on the platform at the cheapest possible price. In 2020, the FTC and 46 states launched an antitrust lawsuit against social media giant Meta, seeking to break up the company’s ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp. That case is continuing. “Over the past decades, the US has watched from the sidelines when the EU has leveraged its antitrust laws against US tech companies, hesitant to intervene,” said Anu Bradford, a Columbia law professor and author of, Digital Empires: The Global Battle to Regulate Technology. “Now, the public opinion in the US is changing as the resentment with tech companies’ outsized influence is growing.” The case — formally known as US et al v. Google — is the first modern antitrust trial that involves a tech giant. It was filed in 2020 under the Trump administration. So far, it has seen testimonies from a number of witnesses, including John Giannandrea, a senior vice president at Apple who was a Google executive at the time Google inked a deal with Apple to be the default search engine on iPhones. On Tuesday, Eddy Cue, another top Apple executive who was responsible for negotiating the agreement that makes Google’s search engine the default choice on Apple’s devices, testified in court. Cue admitted that Apple had a revenue-sharing agreement with Google in exchange for making its search engine default, but specific numbers were only discussed in closed court sessions, The Verge reported. In addition, Cue said that Apple picked Google to be the default search engine because “there wasn’t a valid alternative to Google at the time,” and that still had not changed. Early in the trial, the DOJ presented documents in court showing internal exchanges between senior Google executives, and claimed that the messages showed that the company was aware of its anti-competitive behaviour. Last week, DuckDuckGo CEO Gabriel Weinberg testified in the trial and said that Google’s anti-competitive behaviour was responsible for the privacy-focused search engine’s 2.5 percent market share for search. “Switching is way harder than it needs to be,” Weinberg reportedly said. “There’s just too many steps.” DuckDuckGo has previously said that people should be able to choose their default search engine with a single click, something that is still not possible on both iPhones and Android devices. Google’s lawyers, meanwhile, tried to downplay this concern in court, arguing that changing the default search engine on Apple’s devices took just a handful of taps on iPhones. “Go to settings, tap Safari, then search engine, then make a selection,” said John Schmidtlein, a lawyer who represented the search company. “It takes a matter of seconds.” “This trial focuses on ‘defaults’,” Chengyi Lin, an affiliate professor of strategy at INSEAD, told Al Jazeera. “Behaviour sciences have repeatedly demonstrated that humans rarely deviate from default settings. This case, at the minimum, will bring the idea of choice back into the spotlight for the general population.” The last time the DOJ went so hard after a tech giant was in 1998, when a trial court found that Microsoft hurt Netscape Navigator, a rival browser, by illegally bundling its own Internet Explorer browser with Windows, the world’s dominant operating system. A judge found Microsoft guilty and ordered that the company be split up. But that order was later overturned after the DOJ reached a settlement with the company in 2001. The outcome of the Microsoft case is widely believed to have paved the way for the growth of other browsers including Google Chrome, which became the world’s most-used browser in 2012 by beating Internet Explorer. Presiding over the case is US District Judge Amit Mehta, a private lawyer who was appointed to the bench in 2014 by former President Barack Obama. Mehta has previously served as a judge in other antitrust disputes such as the one in 2015 when he blocked Sysco Corp’s $3.5bn merger with US Foods. Right now, the DOJ has the burden of proving that deals Google struck with other companies stifled the growth of other search engines. Signing such deals isn’t illegal under US law — unless a company is so big that such kinds of exclusivity agreements hurt rivals. If Google is found guilty, Mehta could order the company to be broken up. Or it could simply be ordered to stop continuing existing practices that the court determines to be anticompetitive. This could lead to more competition in the search space, and changing the default search engine on devices you use could become vastly simpler. And it could have major ramifications on how tech companies like Google leverage their existing market dominance to compete in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence. “If the government prevails, it could lead to parts of Google being broken up and the business practices of tech giants would have to change,” Chaffee said. “The impact to consumers would be substantial and far-reaching.” But even if Google wins, this case will change the nature of antitrust itself. “Even if the DOJ were to lose here, it may have accomplished something important: it would send a message to Congress that the existing legal frameworks may not be enough to upend the prevailing antitrust consensus,” said Bradford. “It would signal that Congress may need to pass new laws if it wants to see a change in how antitrust laws can be deployed and used to discipline the tech industry."
"As Hol­ly­wood writ­ers head back to work, what’s in new labour deal?",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/as-hollywood-writers-head-back-to-work-whats-in-new-labour-deal,"Sup­port­ers hail agree­ment to end strike as a vic­to­ry, with com­mit­ments on pay, resid­u­als and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence.","The Hollywood writers’ union has said its members can begin to return to work,ending a five-month strikethat drove production in the United States entertainment industry to a grinding halt. The work stoppage officially ended just after midnight on Wednesday (07:01 GMT), the Writers Guild of America (WGA) said, with writers permitted to return to work. However, the 11,500 members of the union still need to vote on adeal reachedbetween their leadership and production heads. That vote is set to take place between October 2 and 9. Still, the preliminary deal largely showed major gains for writers, whosought commitmentsto respond to an industry that has been transformed by streaming platforms and that faces the prospect of further upheaval amid the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Comedian Adam Conover, who became a leading figure in the strike, hailed the deal as a victory. “We won,” he wrote on social media on Tuesday. David Slack, a union board member and television writer, added that the agreement heralds “a new era for writers – and for labour in our industry”. Here’s all you need to know.  The three-year agreement with studios, producers and streaming services contained significant wins for the writers in several key areas, including compensation, length of employment, size of staff and control of AI. The writers’ union had pushed for minimum increases in pay and future residual earnings from shows from the outset of the strike, which formally began on May 2 and was initially dismissed by studio executives as unrealistic and based on false premises. But the union said it had received widespread complaints about the ad hoc nature of the entertainment industry, which left many writersstruggling between gigswith little in the way of residuals to fall back on. Under the new agreement, writers will get a raise of between 3.5 percent and 5 percent in both pay and residuals earnings. The guild also negotiated a new residuals payment structure based on the popularity of streaming shows; writers will get bonuses for being part of the most popular shows on Netflix, HBO Max and other services, a proposal studios initially rejected. The deal also seeks to address the ways in whichAI could transformthe entertainment landscape, particularly fears the technology could be used to replace various creative roles held by writers. Again, the writers had their demands largely met. Under the agreement, raw, AI-generated storylines will not be regarded as “literary material” – the term used for scripts and the other story forms screenwriters produce. That means writers won’t be competing with AI for credits. The deal also prohibits AI-generated stories from being considered “source” material. This is the contractual term for the novels, video games or other works that writers may adapt into scripts. While companies are not barred from using AI to generate content, under the deal, writers have the right to sue if their work is used to “train” AI to produce similar material. Companies will also be prohibited from requiring writers to use AI, although writers can use the technology in their work if terms are agreed upon with their employer.  The new deal paves the way for popular US late-night talk shows to return to television. Such shows, which rely heavily on writers and often air live or shortly after production, were among the first affected by the strike. Early on Wednesday, host Bill Maher announced that his show would be back on air as of Friday. “My writers and ‘Real Time’ are back! See you Friday night!” he posted on social media. NBC’s The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and Late Night with Seth Meyers; ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live, and The Late Show With Stephen Colbert on CBS all shuttered at the beginning of the strike and were expected to resume in the coming weeks. Scripted shows, however, were expected to take longer to return, with actors still on strike and no negotiations yet on the horizon. The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) has not called offan ongoing strikeby its 160,000 members, who include television actors, stunt performers and other media professionals. Observers have said the writers’ union breakthrough will incentivise speedy negotiations, but a resolution is still expected to take at least a month. SAG members have lodged demands similar to the Hollywood writers, including higher wages, better residual pay, and protection against AI. Some have argued the Hollywood writers’ strike could be a blueprint for other industries in which AI is set to have a transformative effect. As Yvonne Abraham, a columnist at The Boston Globe, noted in July, several economists have argued that AI is most likely to uproot the lowest-paid workers, in turn increasing social inequality. Meanwhile, with the US grappling with an ongoing worker shortage, employees may move to increase leverage to negotiate. “That’s why, even if you’re not a TV person, the protests by actors and writers in Hollywood are relevant to your life and future: If they can hold off the devastating effects of AI, there might be hope for the rest of us,” Abraham wrote."
"Azer­bai­jan ar­rests for­mer top Karabakh min­is­ter as ex­o­dus tops 50,000",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/azerbaijan-arrests-former-top-karabakh-minister-as-exodus-tops-50000,Bil­lion­aire busi­ness­man Ruben Var­danyan served as head of the re­gion­al gov­ern­ment for sev­er­al months.,"Azerbaijan has arrested the former head of Nagorno-Karabakh’s separatist government as he tried to flee into neighbouring Armenia along with tens of thousands of others whofled the regionfollowing Azerbaijan’s military operation last week. The arrest ofRuben Vardanyanon Wednesday was announced by Azerbaijan’s border guard service. Vardanyan, a billionaire businessman who made his fortune in Russia where he owned a major investment bank, moved to Nagorno-Karabakh in 2022 and served as the head of the regional government for several months before stepping down earlier this year. His wife Veronika Zonabend said on his Telegram channel that he had been arrested while trying to flee as part of a mass departure by ethnic Armenians after Azerbaijan took back control of Karabakh in a swift offensive last week. Azerbaijan had previously expressed reservations about Vardanyan, calling him an obstacle to peace. Moreover, his relations with Armenia’s Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan – over the role of Russian peacekeepers – were also strained. Azerbaijan’s border service said he had been taken to the capital Baku and handed over to other state agencies. Nagorno-Karabakh is recognised internationally as part of Azerbaijan, but the 120,000 ethnic Armenians living there dominate the region. Baku and Yerevan have been vying for control over the region for decades and have fought two wars. Many ethnic Armenians are fleeing, abandoning their homes and boarding cars and trucks that have clogged the snaking mountain road that leads to Armenia. Karabakh authorities said more than 50,000 had left so far. Azerbaijan has rejected Armenian accusations of ethnic cleansing. Azerbaijan’s Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov said at the United Nations on Thursday that his country is determined to guarantee Nagorno-Karabakh residents “all rights and freedoms” in line with the country’s constitution and international human rights obligations, including safeguards for ethnic minorities. The European Union said it was sending more humanitarian aid “in solidarity with those who had no choice but to flee” – a significant change from an earlier statement where it referred to people who had “decided to flee”. UN Special Rapporteur Morris Tidball-Binz said Azerbaijan must “promptly and independently investigate alleged or suspected violations of the right to life reported in the context of its latest military offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh”. Meanwhile, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has called on Azerbaijan to be transparent when it comes to a potential international observer mission to the fought-over Nagorno-Karabakh region. “We look to Nagorno-Karabakh with the greatest concern. Nobody really knows how the people there are doing and what they have to go through,” Baerbock said on Wednesday, according to a statement. The US State Department said it will work with allies and partners in coming days on an international monitoring mission. Matthew Miller, the State Department spokesperson, told journalists that despite Russia facilitating negotiations in the past, something that Washington has welcomed, its role in the past week has not been productive.

Gaza grad­u­ates de­mand UN­R­WA so­lu­tions for high un­em­ploy­ment rate,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/gaza-graduates-demand-unrwa-solutions-for-high-unemployment-rate,"Un­em­ploy­ment rate in Gaza con­tin­ues to be among the high­est in the world, hit­ting 70 per­cent among young grad­u­ates.","Gaza City –Since her graduation 10 years ago, Amal Shanioura has been searching for a suitable job opportunity in business administration, but has had no success. The 32-year-old’s frustration took her last week to a protest in front of the headquarters of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Refugees (UNRWA), where demonstrators demanded the body provide more job opportunities in Gaza, and an end to the blockade imposed on the enclave by Israel. Dozens of graduates participated in the protest, raising slogans denouncing thedeteriorating economic situationand the lack of job opportunities amid a sharp rise in the Gaza unemployment rate, which, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, is higher than 45 percent. The United Nations has said that 81 percent of the population is living in poverty. Youth unemployment statistics, which cover 19 to 29-year-olds, are particularly stark when it comes to comparing the occupied West Bank to Gaza – 32 percent in the West Bank are unemployed, compared with 70 percent in Gaza. “Like any graduate, I volunteered in several places and institutions related to my specialty to no avail,” Shanioura told Al Jazeera. “I also worked in some jobs intermittently, but they soon ended and I rejoined the ranks of unemployment.” “As a citizen, I have the right to obtain a suitable job opportunity, especially from UNRWA, which offers permanent or temporary employment programmes for graduates.” Iman al-Qarinawi, 24, who graduated from the College of Pharmacy two years ago, told Al Jazeera that she had never imagined that her efforts during five years studying at university would be in vain. “I graduated with a high average [grade] and have sufficient skills and experience to join the labour market, but the reality in Gaza is harsher than all expectations,” al-Qarinawi said. “I volunteered to work in several private pharmacies but was unable to obtain a job opportunity,” al-Qarinawi added. “I feel very frustrated with the situation in Gaza.” Al-Qarinawi has three other siblings, all graduates in different fields, and all of whom are unemployed and sitting at home. “The issue of unemployment has become more like a general phenomenon in the homes of the Gaza Strip,” she added. “Almost every home has two or three unemployed graduates.” Salah Abdel Ati, a Gaza-based legal and economic researcher, told Al Jazeera that university graduates should be in a position where they can expect to have job opportunities, but that Israel’s blockade of Gaza since 2007 had severely damaged the enclave’s economy. Abdel Ati said 180,000 students graduate annually from universities in Gaza, entering a job market where opportunities are few and far between. “Since refugees represent 70 percent of the population [in Gaza], UNRWA is required to provide them with job opportunities and operational programmes, especially in light of the difficult economic conditions,” he said. According to Abdel Ati, local estimates indicated that about 200,000 graduates in Gaza are unemployed and unemployment rates are increasing. Directing his message to the commissioner-general of UNRWA, Abdel Ati demanded the creation of an emergency programme for graduates in the Gaza Strip. “Youths need development projects and to be provided with soft loans that help them build their future,” he added. UNRWA did not respond to a request for comment from Al Jazeera. However, on Monday, the body’s media adviser in Gaza, Adnan Abu Hasna, said in a statement that UNRWA needed $190m until the end of the year to overcome a budget deficit. That includes funding to cover staff salaries, as well as “$75m for food coupons in Gaza because they are a lifeline for the people”, Abu Hasna said. According to the World Labour Organisation, the unemployment rate in Gaza is among the highest in the world. “Almost every second economically active Gazan is out of work … two-thirds are unemployed and few can find a job,” the organisation said in a report released this year. Theeconomic crisis facing Gaza, which has facednumerous attacks by Israelsince Hamas took over the territory in 2007, is also evidenced by the more than half of the Palestinians in Gaza who rely on humanitarian aid, and the nearly one-third of households who have been categorised as experiencing “catastrophic” or “extreme” levels of need. The conditions in the Gaza Strip, closed off from the outside world in an area 365 square kilometres (141sq miles) big, have forced many Gaza Palestinians to think about something that is notoriously difficult for them – leaving. Musbah Mukhaimer, 29, studied health administration and has worked as a volunteer in a number of governmental and private facilities, but he has not been able to obtain a stable job opportunity. “A young man my age is in dire need of work in order to build his future, get married, and raise a family, but life in Gaza does not guarantee even the basics,” Mukhaimer said. Mukhaimer called on UNRWA to activate programmes to re-employ graduates, stressing that “Palestinian youth have the right to live a decent life like the rest of the world.” “We need job-creating programmes and training that support graduates in obtaining job opportunities and providing a decent life for them and their families.” "
US Sen­a­tor Bob Menen­dez pleads not guilty to cor­rup­tion charges,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/us-senator-bob-menendez-pleads-not-guilty-to-corruption-charges,"Menen­dez, who is ac­cused of ac­cept­ing bribes to ad­vance Egypt­ian gov­ern­ment in­ter­ests, faces grow­ing calls to re­sign.","Top United States Senator Bob Menendez has pleaded not guilty to corruption charges amid growing calls for his resignation. Menendez entered his not-guilty plea in federal court in New York on Wednesday, just days after the Democratic Party legislator expressed confidence that hewould be exoneratedin the criminal case. The senator’s four co-defendants – his wife Nadine Menendez and businessmen Jose Uribe, Fred Daibes and Wael Hana – also pleaded not guilty this week. Dozens of Menendez’s fellow Democrats in Congress have urged him to step down since the indictment was announced late last week, underscoring mounting political pressure against the longtime senator. So far, Menendez has temporarily withdrawn from his role as chair of the influential Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, but he has vowed to fight the charges against him.  “I firmly believe that when all the facts are presented, not only will I be exonerated, but I still will be New Jersey’s senior senator,” he told reporters on Monday. Federal prosecutors haveaccused Menendezof accepting bribes in exchange for political favours, including advancing Egyptian government interests. On Wednesday, Dick Durbin, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, joined the mounting calls from US lawmakers demanding Menendez’s resignation. “Leaders in New Jersey, including the Governor and my Senate colleague Cory Booker, have made it clear that [Senator] Menendez can no longer serve. He should step down,” Durbin wrote in a social media post. Senator Bernie Sanders on Tuesday called on the chamber’s Ethics Committee to open a probe into the allegations against Menendez.  The Department of Justice has alleged that the senator and his wife accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from three businessmen in return for using Menendez’s “official position to protect and enrich them and to benefit the Government of Egypt”. Authorities said they found gold bars and large amounts of cash stuffed in envelopes in Menendez’s home, which they linked to the corruption scheme. As the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Menendez has had a major influence on US policy towards Egypt, including the approval of weapon sales and aid to Cairo. In one instance in 2018, according to prosecutors, Menendez texted his wife to inform Hana – the Egyptian-American businessman also charged last week – that he had removed a hold on an arms deal with Egypt. Hana then forwarded the information to an Egyptian official who replied with a “thumbs up” emoji, the indictment says. One of the most hawkish Democrats on foreign policy, Menendez is a staunch Israel supporter and an outspoken advocate of sanctions against US adversaries, including Venezuela and Cuba. He also opposed the 2015 multilateralIran nuclear deal.  Some of his political allies, including pro-Israel groups, have come to his defence since the indictment was announced. “The pro-Israel community deeply appreciates [Senator] Menendez’s leadership in strengthening the US-Israel relationship,” a spokesperson for theAmerican Israel Public Affairs Committee(AIPAC), a lobby group, told Jewish Insider in a statement. “Like all Americans, he deserves the presumption of innocence.” The Department of State has refused to comment on the charges, citing the ongoing legal case. The White House has acknowledged that the charges are “serious” but stopped short of calling on Menendez to resign from the Senate. "
Namib­ia sus­pends poul­try im­ports from South Africa af­ter bird flu fears,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/namibia-suspends-imports-south-africa,"South Africa was Namib­ia’s ‘pre­ferred sup­pli­er’ of chick­en, but it also im­ports poul­try from Eu­rope and South Amer­i­ca.","Namibia has suspended imports of live poultry, birds, and poultry products from South Africa following the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in the neighbouring country. The move, which takes immediate effect, was triggered by an “alarming” increase in cases of “highly pathogenic avian influenza”, Namibia’s agriculture ministry said. “Importation and in-transit movement” of live chickens, poultry meat, eggs and chicks from South Africa would be suspended “until further notice” it said. South Africa, one of the continent’s major poultry producers, reported the first bird flu cases in commercial farms in April, according to an industry group. Due to its proximity, South Africa was Namibia’s “preferred supplier” of chicken, but the country also imports poultry from Europe and South America, agriculture ministry spokesman Jona Musheko told AFP. Earlier this month, the South African Poultry Association (SAPA) said the nation was contending with two different strains of the virus, the infamous H5N1 and a new strain identified as H7N6. Producer Quantum Foods saidlast weekthat this year it had lost almost two million chickens – worth a total of more than 100 million rand ($5.2m) – because of the disease. Bird flu does not typically infect humans. But H5N1 is increasingly infecting mammals worldwide, raising fears it could pass on more easily to people. The virus has typically been confined to seasonal outbreaks, but since 2021 cases have emerged year-round, and across the globe, leading to what experts say is the largest outbreak ever seen. SAPA said the number of avian flu cases in South Africa this year was higher than in any year since the first outbreaks were reported in commercial farms in 2017."

Two Bahraini servicemen in Saudi Arabia were initially confirmed dead inMonday’s drone attack, before a third soldier succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday, the Bahrain Defence Force said. The attack took place as the soldiers were patrolling Saudi Arabia’s southern border with Yemen. “We mourn one of our men who was martyred today as a result of his serious injuries after the Houthi attack on the southern border of Saudi Arabia,” the Bahrain Defence Force said on Wednesday, announcing the death of the third soldier. Bahrain’s state agency identified the soldier as First Warrant Officer Adam Salem Naseeb, and said he had “valiantly gave his life in the line of duty”. There has been no comment from the Houthi rebel group on the incident. Bahrain has demanded the Iran-aligned rebel group hand over those responsible for the attack, which came amid efforts to reach a deal between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis. A Saudi-led coalition militarily intervened in Yemen in 2015 to support Yemeni government forces against the Houthis. Hundreds of thousands are believed to have been killed in the war, mostly from indirect causes, and 80 percent of the population are dependent on aid. The drone attack represents a major escalation after more than a year of relative calm brokered by the United Nations in Yemen as peace efforts gain momentum. Last week, a Houthi delegationconcluded a visitto the Saudi capital Riyadh, after five days of talks with Saudi officials, following an official invitation sent by the kingdom. It was the first such official visit to Saudi Arabia since thewar broke out in Yemenin 2014, after the Houthis forced out a Saudi-backed government and captured much of the country, including the capital Sanaa. Some progress was made regarding two main conditions, including a timeline for foreign troops exiting Yemen and a mechanism for paying public wages, sources familiar with the meeting said. "
"Ukraine strikes deep in­side Crimea, cuts through Surovikin Line",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/ukraine-strikes-deep-inside-crimea-cuts-through-surovikin-line,"Ukraine dealt a crip­pling blow to the Black Sea Fleet lead­er­ship, re­port­ed­ly killing many of­fi­cers at their HQ.","Ukraine scored devastating deep strikes against Russian-occupied Crimea in the 83rd week of the war, as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy toured Europe andthe United Statespicking up pledges of new long-range weapons and financing. At the same time, Ukrainian and Western sources confirmed that Ukrainian troops had broken through the first and strongest line of Russian defence on the southern front, known as the Surovikin Line after the general who devised it. That success could accelerate their march towards the cities of Tokmak and Melitopol. Ukraine attacked three targets in occupied Crimea in as many days, honing its signature tactic of using a wave of drones to destroy or distract air defences, followed by a wave of missiles. Satellite images showed that attacks destroyed half of the Black Sea Fleet’s communications command centre in Verkhnosadove, 16 kilometres (10 miles) northeast of the fleet base in Sevastopol, on September 20.  The following day Ukraine attacked the Saky airfield – the second time it has done so during the war. The Ukrainian broadcaster Suspilne reported the attack caused “serious damage” and that 12 Russian combat aircraft were present, including Su-24 and Su-30 fighter-bombers. The most crippling attack came on September 22. Ukraine hit the Black Sea Fleet command headquarters and claimed to have killed 34 officers, including fleet commander Admiral Viktor Sokolov. A further 105 were reportedly wounded. One Sevastopol resident filmed the moment when the second missile struck. Russia’s defence ministry attempted to deny the attack, and laterdeniedSokolov was dead, circulating a video purporting to show him taking part in a teleconference on September 26. Ukraine’s military intelligence chief said the attack also seriously wounded the commander of Russian forces on the southern front, Colonel General Alexander Romanchuk. Russian occupation authorities said Ukraine targeted Sevastopol again the following day, but air defences neutralised the attack. Improved intelligence to “understand when the Russian leadership is getting together” was one reason for Ukraine’s success, Colonel Seth Krummrich, who has led special forces detachments in Afghanistan and the Middle East, and currently serves as vice president for Global Guardian, a security consultant, told Al Jazeera. The second was improved weapons systems from the West. Ukraine used Storm Shadow missiles provided by the United Kingdom and France. The political result was that “people are going to feel vulnerable,” said Krummrich. “You have a lot of wounded coming back to Russia who are disillusioned or resentful and you have a lot of people who are not coming back at all,” he said. “The truth is definitely on the Russian street … this is like radiation or toxicity, slowly building up in the population, and over time it could become lethal to a government.” Ukrainian knowledge of the terrain was also important, US special forces commander Dimitries Andrew Grimes told Al Jazeera. “They know the territory; they know where the targets are. They know Crimea and Sevastopol and how to achieve the effects they want to achieve,” he said. The attacks in Crimea coincided with a series of visits abroad by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, designed to pick up diplomatic, military and financial aid. The tactic apparently worked. US media, citing government sources, confirmed Washington would provide Army Tactical Missiles, or ATACMS, which Ukraine has been seeking. The 300km-range (186-mile) weapon has significantly greater reach than the 250km-range (155-mile) Storm Shadow missile, but independent weapons analyst Colby Badhwar said the ATACMS’ key advantage was speed. Storm Shadows are launched from aircraft, meaning a two-hour delay between identifying a target and striking it, allowing for time to mount the missiles and flying the aircraft within range of the target. “Ground launched ballistic missiles on the other hand, can be fired from a launcher already near the front line, and hit their target within a matter of minutes, thanks to their speed,” wrote Badhwar. “This responsiveness is critical for engaging Time Sensitive Targets.” These include missile launchers, aircraft and battlefield armour. ATACMS would also boost Ukraine’s thin inventory of sophisticated missiles. The Washington Post said the administration of US President Joe Biden was considering only the cluster version of ATACMS, but retired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges said this was unsuitable for Ukraine because it has a shorter range than the single warhead version. It would “not [be] as effective at destroying large Russian facilities in Crimea,” he told Newsweek. “The [Biden] administration still seems to have a fear of providing long-range precision strike capability, which Ukraine might use against targets inside Russia,” Hodges said. Ukraine has been using only weapons of its own manufacture to hit Russia, and on September 24 it struck the Khalino Airfield near Kursk, reportedly killing aviation officers. Geolocated footage placed Ukrainian armoured vehicles behind the Russian first line of defence in Verbove, western Zaporizhia, on September 21. The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, a think tank, said this was the first instance of Ukrainian forces operating beyond the tri-layered defence – part of what is known as the Surovikin Line. Two days later, Ukraine’s southern forces commander told CNN, “we have a breakthrough”, and the ISW confirmed the advance. “These fortifications are not the final defensive line in Russia’s defence in depth in western Zaporizhia Oblast, but rather a specific series of the best-prepared field fortifications arrayed as part of a near-contiguous belt of an anti-vehicle ditch, dragon’s teeth, and fighting positions about 1.7 – 3.5km (1.05-2.17 miles) west of Verbove,” the ISW said. Russian military reporters confirmed that Ukrainian units broke into Verbove itself on September 22. They also reported Ukrainian progress towards Novoprokopivka, in the same sector of the Zaporizhia region. According to one, Ukrainian forces were within 800 metres of the settlement. Ukraine’s success has not come easily. The ISW said Ukrainian forces were pinning down elements of three Russian divisions, and that additional elements of other divisions had been called forward from rear defence positions in Tokmak, 18km (11.2 miles) away from the front, to assist them. “It’s obvious the Russians are on the defensive right now,” said Grimes. “They’re operating with conscript forces because they’ve lost a lot of their élite forces, so they’re throwing their conscripts into the meat grinder.” Russian commanders have also ignored their own playbook, whereby “one echelon of Russian forces slows a Ukrainian tactical advance while a second echelon of forces counterattacks,” said the ISW. “Russian forces continue to expend significant combat power on counterattacking to hold their current positions and appear to be resisting the operationally sound course of action of falling back to prepared defensive positions further south,” it said. Some observers have said Ukraine risks losing global support because its advance has been slow. Krummrich believed Ukraine’s deliberative approach was key to its success. “When [countries] see Ukraine moving forward, that strengthens their righteous position on the world stage to say, ‘You need to back us’. If the Russians were blowing through Ukraine, a lot of midrange countries might say, ‘We’re going to hedge our bets on this.’”"
Slo­va­kia’s knife-edge elec­tion to de­ter­mine stance on Ukraine,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/slovakias-knife-edge-election-to-determine-stance-on-ukraine,Robert Fico’s win could raise the prospect of Slo­va­kia drop­ping its staunch sup­port of the war-torn coun­try.,"Robert Fico, Slovakia’s three-time prime minister, has a chance to return to power in a closely fought early election on Saturday, raising the prospect of the central European country dropping its staunch support of neighbouring Ukraine. Fico’s SMER-SSD party has a narrow lead over liberal Progressive Slovakia (PS), which has pledged to stay the course on foreign policy, in two out of four final opinion polls. Late voter shifts put PS a whisker ahead in the other two polls. A government led by Fico’s party could forge an alliance with Hungarian leader Viktor Orban, who has been an outlier on Ukraine and spars with the European Union over the rule of law. Such an alliance may be reinforced if Poland’s conservative PiS wins another term in October, although PiS has a hawkish view on Russia. The leading Slovak party is expected to get the first chance from liberal President Zuzana Caputova to form a cabinet. But who succeeds will depend on the results of half a dozen smaller parties as SMER-SSD and PS will fall short of a majority and need several allies in the 150-seat parliament. The third-largest party and possible kingmaker is the moderate-left Hlas (Voice) of Peter Pellegrini, a former member of SMER-SSD and prime minister in 2018-20. He has kept his options open but is seen closer to Fico. Fico, 59, resigned in 2018 after protests against corruption following the murder of an investigative journalist. He adopted more pro-Russian views, amplified by disinformation on social networks, in opposition to a centre-right coalition that ruled the country from 2020. That coalition fell apart last year and was replaced by a caretaker cabinet. Fico has pledged to end military aid to Ukraine, a sharp U-turn from Slovakia’s current position as a supplier of heavy equipment to its eastern neighbour. “We refuse statements and positions that state that the current Russia-Ukraine conflict is our conflict as well,” Fico told the Reuters news agency in an email. Political analyst Grigorij Meseznikov said that, despite fiery rhetoric, Fico had a record of avoiding unnecessary clashes with Brussels or NATO allies, but having Orban as an ally would embolden him. “Orban has managed to at least complicate adopting [Russia] sanctions packages … Fico will be doing the same,” he said. “They will support each other.” “He will stop the weapons [for Ukraine], that is what he gains support on.” Fico has criticised migrants being allowed through Slovakia and said in a Tuesday television debate he would immediately impose controls on the border with Hungary. Fico’s policies would depend on what coalition SMER-SSD could form. Potential partners range from Hlas to the far-right Republika, which foreign diplomats said would be a red line for Slovakia’s allies. Centrist liberal voters have flocked to the nonparliamentary PS, led by Oxford political science graduate and European Parliament Vice-Chairman Michal Simecka, 39. PS has ruled out working with extremists or with Fico. The party has run a strongly pro-European campaign and would be closer within central Europe to the Czech Republic. It is open to working with small conservative parties, though any such alliance could be unstable due to ideological differences. Fico faced criminal charges in 2022 of using sensitive information on political opponents. The charges, which he denied, have been dropped, though the investigation continues. Fico has sought the removal of the country’s special prosecutor dealing with high-level corruption cases. Any such steps would be closely watched by Brussels, which could withhold EU subsidies – as it has in rows with Poland and Hungary – if it deems they go against rule of law, an EU diplomat told Reuters."

As the new school year begins, there is hope that the classroom will bring back a sense of routine and normalcy. But the trauma of the past eight months has not gone away, with children continuing to deal with displacement, grief, and anxiety. Experts warn that if the mental health of these children is not handled carefully, there could be long-term consequences.

US al­low­ing Is­raelis to trav­el visa-free de­spite dis­crim­i­na­tion fears,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/biden-administration-confirms-it-will-let-israelis-travel-visa-free-to-us,"Wash­ing­ton says Is­rael’s ad­mis­sion to Visa Waiv­er Pro­gram recog­nis­es ‘shared se­cu­ri­ty in­ter­ests, close co­op­er­a­tion’.","US President Joe Biden’s administration has confirmed it will allow Israelis to travel visa-free to the United States, despitecondemnation and concernsover Israel’s treatment of Palestinian and Arab-American travellers. In a statement on Wednesday, the US Department of Homeland Security said Israel had been designated for the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) and that Israeli nationals will be able to travel to the US without a visa by November 30. “The designation of Israel into the Visa Waiver Program is an important recognition of our shared security interests and the close cooperation between our two countries,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkassaid. “This designation, which represents over a decade of work and coordination between the United States and Israel, will enhance our two nations’ collaboration on counterterrorism, law enforcement, and our other common priorities.” Michael Herzog, Israel’s ambassador to the US, also lauded the decision on Wednesday as a “significant milestone” in the relationship between the two countries. “Our people-to-people ties, which are the backbone of our special relationship, will only grow stronger,” Herzog wrote in a social media post.  The move followsa high-profile meetinglast week between Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, where the two leaders pledged continued cooperation. But the prospect of Israel’s entry into the VWP has faced widespread condemnation from Arab-American civil rights advocates. That is because one of the main elements of the programme is what is known as “reciprocity”; countries in the VWP must allow visa-free travel for American citizens in exchange for a similar easing of visa requirements for their own nationals travelling to the US. However, scores of US and other foreign nationals of Palestinian and other Arab descent are routinely turned away by Israeli authorities, who control all access to the occupied Palestinian territories. For example,Israel in 2019 blockedUS Congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib from visiting the country and the occupied Palestinian territories over “their boycott activities against Israel”. In Wednesday’s statement, the Biden administration said Israel “made updates to its entry policies to meet the VWP requirement to extend reciprocal privileges to all US citizens without regard to national origin, religion, or ethnicity”. “This important achievement will enhance freedom of movement for U.S. citizens, including those living in the Palestinian Territories or traveling to and from them,” said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  Still, human rights advocates have cast doubt on whether Israel would live up to its commitments. On Tuesday, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) said it had filed a lawsuit against Israel’s VWP designation. “Credible reports and ADC’s own investigations have shown that Israel failed to meet all of the legal requirements for admission,” the group said. Abed Ayoub, the ADC’s executive director, told Al Jazeera earlier this week that by letting Israel into the programme, the Biden administration “has endorsed and embraced Israeli discrimination and apartheid”. “With this decision, the US government will be sending a message that not all American passport holders are equal,” Ayoub said. Leading rights groups and international experts haveaccused Israelof maintaining a system of apartheid against Palestinians. Yet despite widespread criticism of the Israeli government’s human rights record, Biden has said his support for the country is unwavering. Israel receives at least $3.8bn in US military aid annually. “You’ve heard me say many times: Were there no Israel, we’d have to invent one, and I mean it,” the US president told Netanyahu in New York on September 20."
New IMF funds for Sri Lan­ka may be de­layed as re­view sees rev­enue short­fall,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/new-imf-funds-for-sri-lanka-may-be-delayed-as-review-sees-revenue-shortfall,Glob­al lender says it did not reach staff-lev­el agree­ment with Sri Lan­ka in first re­view un­der a $2.9bn bailout pack­age.,"The International Monetary Fund did not reach a staff-level agreement with Sri Lanka in its first review under a $2.9bnbailout package, due to a potential shortfall in government revenue generation, says the lender. Speaking after a two-week visit to the country, IMF delegation head Peter Breuer on Wednesday said a second tranche of about $330m under a lending programme would only be released after the IMF reaches a staff-level agreement, and there was no fixed timeline on when that would take place. “Sri Lanka has made commendable progress in implementing difficult but much-needed reforms. These efforts are bearing fruit as the economy is showing tentative signs of stabilisation,” the IMF said in a statement. “The team will continue its discussions in the context of the First Review with the goal of reaching a staff-level agreement in the near term.”  The IMF delegation said despite early signs of stabilisation, fulleconomic recoveryis not yet assured and growth momentum remains subdued. In the last six months, Sri Lanka has seen its runaway inflation drop to 1.3 percent in September, its currency appreciate by about 12 percent and foreign exchange reserves improve. But the island has struggled to improve its revenue with additional measures likely to be taken in the upcoming budget in mid-November. Despite revenue mobilisation having improved relative to last year, the IMF said revenue was expected to fall short of initial projections by nearly 15 percent by year end. “While partially due to economic factors, the onus of fiscal adjustment would fall on public expenditure if there were no efforts to recoup this shortfall. This could weaken the government’s ability to provide essential public services and undermine the path to debt sustainability,” said the statement.  Sri Lanka’s international bonds were unmoved by the news, trading slightly higher on Wednesday. The bonds are still in deeply distressed territory, trading between 46-48 cents to the dollar, Tradeweb data showed. The global lender said Sri Lanka would need to strengthen tax administration, remove tax exemptions and actively eliminate tax evasion to increase revenues and signal better governance. Sri Lanka accepted offers to exchange about $10bn worth of defaulted local debt for new bonds, taking it a step towards meetingdebt restructuringrequirements ahead of the IMF review. Sri Lanka has also held multiple rounds of talks with bondholders and bilateral creditors including Japan, China and India to reach an agreement to rework itsforeign debtafter suspending repayments in May last year. The island’s debt restructuring is also being discussed at a meeting of the Institute of International Finance and Paris Club scheduled for later in the day, according to the agenda seen by Reuters news agency."
What to ex­pect at the sec­ond Re­pub­li­can de­bate of 2024 US pres­i­den­tial race,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/what-to-expect-at-the-second-republican-debate-of-2024-us-presidential-race,Can­di­dates will make their case as Don­ald Trump con­tin­ues to en­joy a huge lead in the GOP pres­i­den­tial nom­i­na­tion race.,"Washington, DC –The second Republican debate of the 2024 presidential race is set to give rivals of former President Donald Trump a platform to chip away at his massive lead among primary voters — but the question remains whether they can make a dent in his popularity. Wednesday night’s event is set to feature some of the heavy hitters in the Republican Party, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former Vice President Mike Pence. However, thefirst debate in Augustdid not appear to significantly alter the Republican field. Public opinion polls continue to show Trump in first place, with DeSantis a distant second. Last time around, though, entrepreneurVivek Ramaswamydelivered a breakout performance, as he invited attacks from opponents and capitalised on the event’s format to gain more air time for rebuttals. But he remains in third place, far from mounting a serious challenge against Trump. Now, the clock is ticking for the former president’s rivals to make an impression on voters before the primary process kicks off in Iowa in January. With millions of people expected to tune in to Wednesday’s debate, the event represents a golden opportunity for candidates to woo would-be supporters. Here’s all you need to know ahead of the debate.  No. The former president, who is facing four sets ofcriminal charges, will skip the second debate, as he did with the first one. Instead, Trump will travel to Michigan andaddress autoworkerspushing for better pay and working conditions. Democratic President Joe Biden also spoke to striking union members in the state on Tuesday. Trump is leading the Republican field by more than 40 percentage points, according to some public opinion polls. He has previously argued that he had no need to debate his primary rivals, as voters already know his record as president — and a debate would only give his critics a stage on which to bash him. All eight candidates who participated in the last debate said they would support Trump if he wins the nomination, even if he isconvicted of a crimebefore the 2024 elections. The debate will take place at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, north of Los Angeles, California. It will start at 6pm local time (9pm Eastern time/01:00 GMT). The event is expected to last for two hours. “The Republican Party is united around one common goal — Beating Biden — and there is no better place to showcase our conservative vision for the future than the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library,” Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement earlier this week. Former President Reagan is a revered figure in US conservative circles.  Fox Business Network is hosting the debate, which will also air on the main Fox News channel. The Spanish channel Univision will also broadcast the event, and the online platform Rumble will livestream it. Seven candidates qualified for the debate: While Trump is choosing not to attend the event, other Republican presidential hopefuls fell short of the qualifications needed to appear on the debate stage. Ex-Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson — an outspoken opponent of the former president — is the only candidate who qualified forthe first debatebut failed to meet the criteria for the second. Businessman Perry Johnson, former Congressman William Hurd and talk radio host Larry Elder also did not make the cut.  To qualify for the debate, candidates had to amass at least 50,000 unique donors at least 48 hours before the event. They also needed to meet certain polling requirements, including having 3 percent support in at least one credible national poll. Moreover, debate participants had tosign a pledgeto support the eventual Republican nominee in the general elections in November 2024 to “beat Biden”. The third Republican debate will be held in Miami, Florida, on November 8. The requirements to participate will be even stricter in an effort to further shrink the number of contenders on the stage."
‘How do you dis­tin­guish be­tween an abaya and a maxi dress?’,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/how-do-you-distinguish-between-an-abaya-and-a-maxi-dress,"Al Jazeera speaks to a teacher, rights lawyer, ex­pert and ac­tivist on ten­sions be­tween the state and Mus­lim mi­nor­i­ty.","Paris, France –When French students returned to class a few weeks ago, thegovernmentissued a ban on abayas and qamis in public middle and high schools, a move that sawalready fraught tensionsbetween the state and Muslim minority deepen. The government sees the full-length robes worn by some Muslims as a religious symbol. On Monday, the State Council, France’s top administrative court, which oversees disputes concerning civil liberties, upheld the abaya ban. Gabriel Attal, France’s education minister, said the measure was an extension of France’s principle of secularism, known as laicite. “When you walk into a classroom, you shouldn’t be able to identify the pupils’ religion just by looking at them,” Attal said in a TV interview. But as many have struggled to distinguish between an abaya and any other long dress, a sense of confusion and anger prevails among those being targeted. Since September, several young women have been sent home from school for wearing various long dresses, including an openkimono. Others have reportedly been told to wear belts to “show off their curves”, instead of loose robes. France is home to Europe’s largest Muslim minority, a community of about five million people. “There is clearly a discriminatory element. It is such a blanket ban that can be applied so broadly,” Rim-Sarah Alouane, a French expert on constitutional law and religious freedom, told Al Jazeera. “How do you distinguish between an abaya and a maxi dress? You profile the person. If he or she is a Muslim, there is a de facto suspicion.” Supporters of laicite see it as a way to separate church from state, but critics argue that it has become an indirect form of discrimination. “Laicite has been really misused, and it is quite concerning to see such a necessary principle be weaponised to target a population that has been discriminated against for quite some time,” Alouane said. The French Council of Muslim Faith (CFCM), a national body of Muslim associations, said the abaya on its own is not “a religious sign”. “The word abaya just means dress. If we actually stop people who wear Middle Eastern abayas, almost nobody will be stopped, but we’re controlling girls wearing 5-euro [$5.25] H&M dresses,” Emma, a high school teacher near Strasbourg, told Al Jazeera. Many teachers and activists said the abaya ban is being used to detract from broader issues in France’s education system, including unequal salaries and a significant shortage of teachers, particularly in under-privileged neighbourhoods. According to a recent survey of 508 schools, nearly half of schools lacked a teacher at the start of this school year. “There is a lack of budget and a big pay inequality in the education system,” Emma said, pointing out the inequality between civil servants, who received a pay increase last year, and contract teachers like herself, who are increasingly deployed by the government yet don’t receive the same benefits. French teachers are significantly underpaid in comparison to many other European countries. A study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published last year revealed that primary schoolteachers in France with 15 years of experience earn about 20 percent less than the OECD average — an average of 37,700 euros ($39,800) a year – three times less than their German neighbours. These frustrations, along with long working hours and crowded classrooms, have led teachers to suffer from depression and burnout, according to Emma. At her school, teacher positions remained vacant for long periods due to staff shortages. “In middle school, some pupils didn’t have an English teacher for a whole year before I had them in high school.” Enforcing the abaya ban adds another responsibility to already overworked teachers. “It puts pressure on teachers because we’re supposed to inspect students when we arrive in class,” she said. “As an adult and as a teacher, I would never think of looking at my pupils’ bodies or clothes. I’m there to do my job and not to control the bodies of minors.” Recently, a student at the school where Emma teaches was contacted by the headmaster who “thought her dress was too large”. The headmaster offered the student, who is 13, “a chance to wear a belt to show off her curves and to not confuse it with an Islamic dress”. “It’s 2023, and in the country of human rights, minors are being asked to show off their bodies or wear less clothing,” Emma said. According to Yasser Louati, political activist and head of the Committee for Justice and Liberties, the abaya ban in schools does nothing to address the need for education reform. “The idea that imposing dress on students will solve the country’s education problems is ridiculous,” Louati told Al Jazeera. “[President Emmanuel] Macron has loads of ideas for the market but nothing for our kids or our teachers”. France prohibited symbols that “ostensibly display a religious affiliation” in a 2004 law that critics say has been used to target Muslims. “The danger is that we are going to further isolate Muslim students from the rest of the population,” he said. “Imagine the situation in 10 to 15 years when these kids grow up to be adults, and they have been singled out by French laws.” Since the abaya ban went into effect, several students have been sent home for wearing long garments, including a 15-year-old girl wearing an open kimono over jeans and a shirt in Lyon. The student said her clothes did not represent any religious affiliation. Al Jazeera obtained a recording of a meeting between the student and the head of her school, who insisted that the student’s dress was an abaya. “Do not take me for a fool. That outfit is similar to an abaya. As headmaster, I must forbid you from entering school in this way, in this outfit,” he said. The student insisted that her kimono was not an abaya. “It is not an abaya. There are no sleeves,” she said. When the student refused to change, the head of school called her parents to pick her up. Human rights lawyer Nabil Boudi filed a complaint for acts of discrimination on the basis of religious affiliation on behalf of the student. “The kimono was open, and she was asked to leave the class. A kimono is not a religious symbol,” Boudi told Al Jazeera. “We’re no longer talking just about religious symbols. We’re talking about any clothing that could even be considered religious, and it is up to the head of the school to decide,” he added. Boudi sent a letter to the special rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism at the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on behalf of his client, detailing issues he found with the abaya ban in schools. “We believe that the French government and in particular the ministry of education has failed to take the necessary measures to prevent all forms of discrimination against women,” Boudi said.

Anti-mi­grant rhetoric dom­i­nates pol­i­tics in Poland ahead of Oc­to­ber vote,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/anti-migrant-rhetoric-dominates-politics-in-poland-ahead-of-october-vote,Politi­cians from across the po­lit­i­cal spec­trum en­gage in anti-mi­grant lan­guage ahead of Oc­to­ber 15 polls.,"Warsaw, Poland– Dressed in a sharp suit, Rafal Pankowski, the amicable head of Never Again, a renowned Polish anti-racism organisation, delicately sips an Arabic coffee in the bustling centre of Poland’s capital, Warsaw. The city is gripped in political fervour as Poland heads into a general election on October 15. Colourful political posters line the streets, and campaigners thrust leaflets at pedestrians enjoying the last throws of warm weather. There is “no doubt” that migration is the topic dominating the election campaigns, Pankowski says firmly. The right-wing populist government elected to power in the 2015 elections exploited the refugee crises to promote a relentless campaign of “xenophobic propaganda” that painted non-European refugees and migrants, especially from the Middle East, as “terrorists”,Pankowski had previously told Al Jazeera. Recalling his earlier statement, he says it comes as little surprise that the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party and the far-right Confederation alliance have continued to push this narrative during the current election campaign to garner support among their existing voter base.  He says the conversation around migration in Poland has changed dramatically in the past three years as two different refugee crises have erupted on the country’s western borders. One of them began inOctober 2021and has seen thousands of refugees and migrants, mainly from the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa, attempt the crossing from Belarus while the other began in February 2022 when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, sending millions of Ukrainian refugees into Poland.  The first crisis was seized upon by right-wing parties, which incorporated it into an existing propaganda narrative aimed at generating fear over an “invasion” of non-Europeans. When the second refugee crisis arose, there simply was not the same backlash. In contrast, support for Ukrainian refugees was felt across the political spectrum. However, Pankowski has been surprised by a shift in rhetoric over recent months among the right-wing parties to include anti-Ukrainian sentiments. In a further unexpected twist, other parties outside the right-wing political spheres have tried to “outdo each other”, Pankowski says, by supporting a firm response to non-European refugees and migrants entering the country. Rafal Wasowicz, a stocky, straight-talking office worker, stands outside an elegant art house cinema. He has come to see the Green Border, a film directed by veteran Polish filmmaker Agnieszka Holland about the Poland-Belarus border crisis, which has sparked the ire of Poland’s right-wing parties, with Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro comparing the film to Nazi propaganda. “I think this film shows the reality more than the government,” Wasowicz says. “They say we are at war, but the government does not see the migrants as people.” The film focuses on a family from Syria and a woman from Afghanistan who are aggressively pushed back and forth by border guards and soldiers as local activists risk being sent to jail for trying to bring them to safety. Rights abuses have long been reported on both sides of the border as Polish border guards and police routinely push those seeking asylum in the European Union back into Belarus, according to civil society groups and grassroots organisations working on the border. Al Jazeera has spoken to several people who have tried the crossing since 2021 and have reportedmultiple human rights violationsagainst them by both Polish and Belarusian authorities. The constant back and forth in the often damp, freezing border forests have led to at least 37 deaths since October 2021, according to activists, but the true toll is feared to be far higher. The government, in turn, has positioned itself as protecting the country from a hybrid war being waged by Belarus. Belarusian authorities, mainly via tourist agencies in the Middle East, have been found to have promoted misinformation campaigns offering a route into the EU via Belarus. This was viewed by Poland and the EU as a strategy by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, the closest ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, to destabilise the region. Poland’s government plans to run adverts to defend its treatment of migrants and refugees crossing from Belarus before screenings of Green Border. Deputy Interior Minister Blazej Pobozy, who describes the film as “disgusting slander”, told reporters: “Our ads show the context of the hybrid [border] operation and the course of this operation and what solutions we have introduced to secure the safety of Polish women and men.” It is not just the right-wing parties stoking fears of mass migration from non-European, primarily Muslim countries. Former European Council President Donald Tusk, leader of the centrist opposition Civic Coalition, slammed the current government in July for involvement in an EU migration plan that he says would “allow even more people to come from countries like Saudi Arabia, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Nigeria and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan”. In a series of social media videos posted in July in connection with unrest in France triggered bythe police killing of a 17-year-old teenagerof Algerian and Moroccan descent during a traffic stop, Tusk concludes: “Poles must regain control over this country and its borders.” In an unexpected twist, the governing party, which had long promoted its tough migration policies, was recently embroiled in a scandal in which its operatives in consulates, especially in Africa and Asia, are reported to have handed out Polish visas for bribes. The Civic Coalition seized the opportunity to discredit the ruling party, with Tusk describing it as “the biggest scandal of the 21st century in Poland”. Pankowski says the far right is now promoting a fear that the millions of Ukrainian refugees in the country are threatening a Polish “mono-ethnic state”. “For the first time in a very long time, Poland has become a country of immigration rather than emigration,” he says, which represents a seismic demographic change in a country where 10 years ago, just 0.3 percent of the country was born abroad. Now, the hashtag with the slogan “Stop the Ukrainisation of Poland”, promoted by the Confederation alliance, has been trending on social media, and Pankowski’s organisation has received almost daily reports of hate speech directed at Ukrainian children in schools. He says a racist trope centring around groups of non-European male refugees and migrants being a sexual threat to Polish women has been reversed. With martial law in place in Ukraine, men 18 to 60 years old may not leave the country, which means almost all Ukrainian refugees are women and children. “The stereotype is that Ukrainian women are out there to steal your husband,” Pankowski says."
"More than a third of Nagorno-Karabakh’s eth­nic Ar­me­ni­ans flee, says Yere­van",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/more-than-a-third-of-nagorno-karabakhs-ethnic-armenians-flee-says-yerevan,"Ar­me­nia says 42,500 peo­ple have ar­rived, fear­ing their rights and se­cu­ri­ty will not be pro­tect­ed in Azer­bai­jan.","More than a third of the 120,000 ethnic Armenians living in Nagorno-Karabakhhave fled the regionas part of an exodus triggered by a military offensive which brought the enclave back under Azerbaijan’s control. The Armenian government said on Wednesday that about 47,000 “forcibly displaced” people have moved from the long-troubled region to Armenia. Azerbaijan launched a military offensive on September 19. A day later, separatist authorities said they were forced to lay down their arms and agreed to aRussia-brokered ceasefire. Nagorno-Karabakh’s ethnic Armenians said at least 200 people died in the fighting, including 10 civilians. Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Defence released on Wednesday a list with the names of more than 150 Azerbaijani servicemen who it said died in the military operation. “It shows the scale of the operation that was carried out,” said Al Jazeera’s Osama Bin Javaid, reporting from Shusha, known as Shushi to Armenians, in Karabakh. “We spoke with some people in the Azerbaijani government who said that the advanced weapons they saw, and their number, came as a surprise to them, as they thought that a disarmament process had already begun in 2020, but it was not the case. “They [Azerbaijani officials] say it was important to carry out this operation to make sure that Azerbaijani soil is free of any Armenian serviceman, military personnel or weapon that can be used against Azerbaijan.” While Azeri President Ilham Aliyev promised to guarantee the rights and security of ethnic Armenians, decades of distrust, wars, mutual hatred and violence have left many residents of Nagorno-Karabakh sceptical over the possibility of the region’s peaceful reintegration into Azerbaijani territory. In recent days, long queues of cars have formed on the road linking the region to Armenia. Adding to a sense of uncertainty and fear, an explosion at a petrol station near the region’s capital, Stepanakert, where people were queueing to fuel their cars before leaving for Armenia, killed at least 68 people on Monday night, according to Nagorno-Karabakh’s human rights ombudsman Gegham Stepanyan. Another 290 people were wounded, and 105 were considered missing as of Tuesday evening, he said. Patients are receiving treatment while the process of evacuating the injured continues, the ministry said. But a nearly 10-month blockade imposed by Azerbaijan on the enclave has made medical assistance efforts more difficult due to a long-running shortage of basic goods, from bread to medicine. In December last year, Baku blocked the Lachin corridor, the only road connecting the Karabakh region to Armenia. Visiting Kornidzor, a town on the Armenian border, USAID’s chief Samantha Power announced more than $11.5m in humanitarian assistance “to address displacement from Nagorno-Karabakh”. The separatist enclave is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, including by Armenia, but has been populated by a majority of ethnic Armenians who have sought to unify with Yerevan following the collapse of the Soviet Union. After Azerbaijan and Armenia announced independence in the nineties, Nagorno-Karabakh was at the centre of two wars. Armenians had full control of the territory, and several districts surrounding it in 1994. But Azerbaijan regained control of much of the lost territory in 2020. Both wars caused tens of thousands of civilian casualties, and tens of thousands of internally displaced people and refugees on both sides. Questions loom now on what will happen in the enclave as two rounds of negotiations on the “reintegration” of Nagorno-Karabakh and its ethnic Armenian population have led to no concrete results. "
Pak­istan ex-PM Im­ran Khan moved to an­oth­er jail af­ter cus­tody ex­tend­ed,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/pakistan-ex-pm-imran-khan-moved-to-another-jail-after-custody-extended,Op­po­si­tion leader moved to prison near cap­i­tal af­ter his ju­di­cial re­mand in ‘ci­pher’ case is ex­tend­ed un­til Oc­to­ber 10.,"Islamabad, Pakistan– Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has been transferred to a jail near capital Islamabad after a court extended his custody by two more weeks in astate secrets caserelated to his 2022 removal. Khan, 70, was moved to Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi city on Tuesday night after having spent more than three weeks in Attock Jail some 100km (62 miles) away where he was sent following his conviction in a corruption case last month. Videos on social media showed Khan’s supporters flanking the road and throwing flower petals as a large police convoy took him to Rawalpindi. Though the Islamabad High Court in Augustoverturned his conviction, Khan remains in custody as authorities investigate the leaking of a secret diplomatic cable, called “cipher”, which he claimsproves his allegationthat the United States was behind his removal from power. The US and Pakistani authorities reject the charge.  Khan’s lawyers had petitioned the Islamabad High Court for him to be shifted to another jail alleging he was being denied facilities allowed under prison rules at Attock, one of the largest jails in the country. Members of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party had saidhis life was under threatin Attock Jail. On Tuesday, the court directed the prison authorities to move him to Adiala and ordered that he be provided better facilities as a former premier. “He [Khan] has never once complained about the conditions he was kept in Attock prison and said his focus is solely on the struggle for real freedom for people of Pakistan,” Khan’s lawyer Intazar Hussain Panjutha told Al Jazeera on Wednesday, a day after meeting the opposition leader in jail. Since Khan was removed from power in April last year, he has beendemanding early elections, which the government has rejected. After his conviction in August, he was declared ineligible to contest polls by the election commission, which has announced general elections in January."
Iran’s IRGC suc­cess­ful­ly puts third imag­ing satel­lite into or­bit,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/irans-irgc-successfully-puts-third-imaging-satellite-into-orbit,This is third suc­cess­ful launch of re­con­nais­sance satel­lite by aero­space di­vi­sion of pri­ma­ry branch of Iran’s mil­i­tary.,"Tehran, Iran –Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has successfully put a third satellite into orbit, according to officials. Two officials confirmed on Wednesday that the aerospace division of the elite military force has put the third version of the imaging satellite Nour, which means “light” in Persian, into low orbit. The Noor-3 was reportedly placed in an orbit 450km (280 miles) from the surface of the Earth and, like its predecessors, was taken to space using a Qased – meaning “messenger” – carrier developed by the IRGC. Western officials did not immediately comment on the launch on Wednesday. The first version of the Nourwas successfully launchedin April 2020 into an orbit 425km (265 miles) above the Earth. It became the first military reconnaissance satellite launched by Iran after several failed attempts. The second versionreached a low orbit of 500km (310 miles)in early 2022 using the mixed-fuel carrier. Despite criticism from the West, Iranian officials have promised to carry on with the expanding satellite programme and are expected to launch several more satellites into different orbits in the foreseeable future. In August 2022, anIranian-owned and Russian-built satellite– said to be capable of taking high-resolution images – was successfully launched from a base in Kazakhstan. Western allies have suggested the development of Iranian satellites may violate a United Nations Security Council resolution underpinning the country’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers because the technology could potentially be used to facilitate nuclear weapons. Iran has repeatedly dismissed such claims, maintaining that its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful. The nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), continues to be in limbo after the United States unilaterally withdrew from it in 2018 and reimposed harsh sanctions on Iran. Iranian officials have recently suggested again that they are open to returning to the accord but would first need to see political resolve from the Western parties, which also include France, Germany and the United Kingdom. As part of one of the clauses of the accord, a number of restrictions on Iran’s development of ballistic missiles is set to be automatically lifted next month. But with tensions lingering over the Iranian nuclear programme and Western accusations that Iran has armed Russia with drones for the war in Ukraine, the European powers have said they willmaintain their own sanctions on Irandespite the clause."
US sol­dier who crossed into North Ko­rea back in Amer­i­can cus­tody,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/north-korea-to-expel-us-soldier-who-crossed-from-south-korea,Wash­ing­ton thanks Swe­den for diplo­mat­ic role and Chi­na for as­sis­tance in fa­cil­i­tat­ing tran­sit of Travis King.,"A United States soldier who was detained aftercrossing into North Koreatwo months ago is back in American custody, US officials have said, after Pyongyang said Travis King would be deported. In astatementon Wednesday confirming earlier news reports, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said US officials had “secured the return” of the American soldier. “We appreciate the dedication of the interagency team that has worked tirelessly out of concern for Private King’s wellbeing,” Sullivan said. “In addition, we thank the government of Sweden for its diplomatic role serving as the protecting power for the United States in [North Korea] and the government of the People’s Republic of China for its assistance in facilitating the transit of Private King.” The Associated Press news agency first reported on Wednesday morning that King was in US custody, hours after North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said authorities had finished questioning him. An unnamed US official told AP that King was transferred to US custody in China. KCNA’s earlier report said that King had confessed to illegally entering the North because he harboured “ill feeling against inhuman maltreatment andracial discrimination” within the US Army. After completing its investigation, the “relevant organ of the DPRK decided to expel Travis King, a soldier of the US Army who illegally intruded into the territory of the DPRK”, the news agency reported, using the formal name for North Korea. King bolted into North Korea in July while on a tour of the southern side of an inter-Korean truce village. He was serving nearly two months in a South Korean prison for assault. King was released on July 10 and was being sent home to Fort Bliss, Texas, where he could have faced additional military discipline and discharge from the service. He was escorted as far as customs but left the airport before boarding his plane. It was unclear how he spent the hours until joining the tour in the border village of Panmunjom during which he ran across the border. On Wednesday, Jonathan Franks, a spokesperson for King’s mother, Claudine Gates, said: “Ms Gates will be forever grateful to the United States Army and all its interagency partners for a job well done.” Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett, reporting from the White House on Wednesday morning, said King’s release came as the result of “months-long work” by the United Nations and Sweden. “Sweden in particular took a major role in helping with these negotiations because of course, the United States does not have any formal relations with North Korea,” Halkett said. “What the primary goal of the United States military right now is making sure that he is in good health, and also that he gets the support he needs.” It remains unclear when King will be transferred back to his home country. The border between the two Koreas is heavily fortified but at the Joint Security Area, the frontier is marked only by a low concrete divider and is relatively easy to cross, despite the presence of soldiers on both sides. King’s border crossing came as relations between South and North Korea were at one of their lowest points, with diplomacy stalled and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un calling for increased weapons development, including tactical nuclear warheads. Seoul and Washingtonhave ramped up defence cooperation in response, staging joint military exercises with advanced stealth jets and US strategic assets. "
UN warns of ‘hu­man­i­tar­i­an cat­a­stro­phe’ in grow­ing nu­clear arms race,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/un-warns-of-humanitarian-catastrophe-in-growing-nuclear-arms-race,Guter­res says world is plung­ing into a new nu­clear arms race as North Ko­rea says US is push­ing it to the brink of war.,"United Nations chief Antonio Guterres has warned of “humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions” due to the geopolitical mistrust and competition that has made nuclear risk escalate to Cold War levels. “Any use of a nuclear weapon – anytime, anywhere and in any context – would unleash a humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions,” he told the UNGeneral Assemblyon the final day of its yearly session on Tuesday as North Korea warned that theUS was pushingit to the brink of war. With an evolving nuclear order in which armed nations are expanding and modernising their arsenals, the UN chief called on countries to strengthen their commitments to reducing and, eventually, eliminating nuclear weapons. In astatementreleased on the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, Guterres reminded UN member states of the recently launched policy brief on A New Agenda for Peace – which calls for a recommitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. “On this important Day, we re-affirm our commitment to a world free of nuclear weapons and the humanitarian catastrophe their use would unleash,” Guterres said in the statement. “This means nuclear-weapon States leading the way by meeting their disarmament obligations, and committing to never use nuclear weapons under any circumstances.” Meanwhile, North Korea, in one of the last speeches of the week-long UN General Assembly debate, accused the United States of driving the peninsula “closer to the brink of nuclear war” because of its tighter cooperation with South Korea. Kim Song, North Korea’s ambassador to the United Nations, pointed to the recent formation of the Nuclear Consultative Group, through which the US hopes to integrate its nuclear capacity better with South Korea’s conventional forces. The two allies would increase information sharing and contingency planning, which Kim alleged was to execute a “preemptive nuclear strike” against North Korea. “Due to its sycophantic and humiliating policy of depending on outside forces, the Korean peninsula is in a hair-trigger situation with imminent danger of nuclear war,” Kim said. An envoy from South Korea took the floor to object to the remarks. “Do you really believe, as the DPRK pretends, the Republic of Korea together with the United States conspires to provoke a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula without reasons that will cause catastrophic casualties,” he asked. Hours earlier, South Korea staged its firstmilitary paradein a decade, with some 4,000 troops marching through a rainy Seoul. Yoon Suk-yeol, South Korea’s president, had earlier said that “if North Korea uses nuclear weapons, its regime will be brought to an end by an overwhelming response from the ROK-US alliance”.  In June this year, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institutereportedthat the world’s nuclear powers, and China in particular, increased investment in their arsenals for a third consecutive year in 2022. While the total number of nuclear warheads held by Britain, China, France, India, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia and the United States had fallen by about 1.6 percent to 12,512 over the previous year, SIPRI said the declining trend was on the cusp of a reversal."

Police on Wednesday stormed 26 apartments belonging to 39 members of the Artgemeinschaft network in 12 states, including Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg and Brandenburg. The association counts about 150 members and has links to several far-right groups, said the interior ministry. It uses the cover of a “pseudo-religious Germanic belief in God to spread their worldview which violates human dignity”, said the ministry. Using Nazi-era literature, the association sought to convert the young to adopt its race theories. It also ran an online bookstore that sought to radicalise and attract non-members. “This is a further blow against right-wing extremism and against the intellectual agitators who still spread Nazi ideologies today,” said Interior Minister Nancy Faeser. “This far-right group tried to raise new enemies of the constitution through the disgusting indoctrination of children and youths,” she added. Germany has banned a series of far-right groups in recent months. Last week, it outlawed the local chapter of the US-based Hammerskins neo-Nazi group known for its white supremacist rock concerts. There were about 38,800 people in the right-wing “extremist” spectrum in Germany in 2022, according to a report presented by the BfV federal domestic intelligence agency in June – up from 33,900 in 2021. The number of people considered potentially violent also rose from 13,500 to 14,000. "
"Pak­istan’s Ah­madis liv­ing in fear as graves, re­li­gious sites at­tacked",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/pakistans-ahmadis-living-in-fear-as-graves-religious-sites-attacked,Hu­man Rights Com­mis­sion says at least 34 at­tacks on re­li­gious sites of mi­nor­i­ty Ah­madis have tak­en place so far in 2023.,"Islamabad, Pakistan– Members of Pakistan’s minorityAhmadi communitysay their places of worship and graveyards are being attacked as part of a systemic and coordinated hate campaign. Community spokesman Amir Mahmood told Al Jazeera on Tuesday they are facing a significant increase in attacks, particularly in the eastern province of Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous. Mahmood said at least 74 graves were vandalised in Punjab’s Daska city last week while minarets of two Ahmadi places of worship were demolished near the provincial capital, Lahore. He accused police and administrative officials of demolishing their religious structures – one built before 1947, the year Pakistan was formed after independence from British rule – under pressure from a right-wing religious party. “The religious party, Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), also threatened the local administration of serious consequences if the minarets of our place of worship are not destroyed,” Mahmood said. “They have now issued an ultimatum to the administration to act upon their demands by Friday, which coincides with Prophet Muhammad’s birthday celebrations,” he added. The 500,000-member Ahmadi community is a religious minority in Pakistan, which considers itself Muslim, but was officiallydeclared “non-Muslim”in 1974 through an amendment in the constitution. A decade later, under the dictatorship of former military ruler Zia ul-Haq, a ruling barred the Ahmadis from “posing as Muslims” and disallowed them from publicly referring to themselves as Muslims. They were banned from practising aspects of the Islamic faith or publicly displaying any symbol that identified them as Muslims, including building minarets or domes on mosques, or publicly writing verses from the Quran, the Islamic holy book. On Monday, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, the country’s most prominent rights body, said at least 34 attacks on the Ahmadis’ religious places have taken place since January this year.  According to data compiled by the community, in 2022, at least three Ahmadis werekilled over their faith, while another 108 people were booked in various religious cases. At least 14 mosques and 197 graves belonging to the community were desecrated last year, they alleged. Zaheer Aslam (whose name has been changed), an Ahmadi businessman, told Al Jazeera his ancestors lived in Daska, a small town of less than 200,000 people, even before the country was formed. He said less than 200 households in the town were now Ahmadis. “Our community has always faced prejudice – sometimes viciously, sometimes more subtly. However, this year, the flames of hatred are far more intense,” he said. Aslam said Daska is dotted with TLP banners calling for rallies against Ahmadis for allegedly insulting Islamic religious symbols. “A rally was taken out today [Tuesday] which was full of hate speech against our community, while the administration sits quietly and watches it all unfold,” he told Al Jazeera. Saadat Ali, a police official posted in Daska, said police are trying to ensure law and order in the city ahead of celebrations for the prophet’s birthday. He denied allegations that police were being pressured by the TLP or that police officials themselves desecrated graves. “We received a complaint from TLP about Ahmadis displaying minarets on their places of worship. I told the group it was constructed before 1984 and they should refer to courts to seek guidance. It does not fall under police’s ambit,” Ali told Al Jazeera. But community spokesman Mahmood rejected the claims by the police. “I would like to ask the administration: did they [attackers] not carry out their operation in the dark, under police protection? What right did they have? It was our graveyard, bought by our money, and it only buried people from our community. What law allowed them to take this action?” he asked. While police say they are prepared for any eventuality ahead of Friday’s celebrations, the Ahmadi community in Daska remains apprehensive. Aslam, the business owner, said a majority of people campaigning against Ahmadis do not belong to Daska and had come from nearby towns and villages. “People of the city, by and large, are not active participants in these hate-filled rallies. But circumstances are such that nobody has the courage to come out and publicly support or defend us,” the 47-year-old said. “There is an air of fear and intimidation completely suffocating us. “We were told not to call our places of worship as mosques. We were told not to give azaan [the call to prayer]. We were told not to write Quranic verses on our homes or graves. What do they want from us next? That we stop breathing the same air lest we contaminate it?”"
US halts for­eign as­sis­tance to Gabon af­ter Au­gust 30 coup,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/us-halts-foreign-assistance-to-gabon-after-august-30-coup,Sec­re­tary of State Antony Blinken an­nounces the de­ci­sion in a state­ment re­leased on Tues­day.,"The United States is pausing certain foreign assistance programmes to the government of Gabon following last month’s coup, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement released by the Department of State on Tuesday. The pause would continue while “[we] evaluate the unconstitutional intervention by members of the country’s military”, Blinken said, adding that the move is in line with steps taken by the Economic Community of Central African States and the African Union. The US will nevertheless continue operational activities in the country, including diplomatic and consular operations supporting US citizens. Army officers in Gabon seized power on August 30, annulling an election minutes after an announcement that President Ali Bongo had won, which they said was not credible. Bongo had been in power since 2009. The new military government has promised to oversee free and fair elections but has not given a precise timetable for organising them. A 24-month transition to elections in Gabon would be “reasonable” after last month’s coup, the military-appointedPrime Minister Raymond Ndong Sima was quoted as saying by French news agency AFP earlier this month. The Bongo family’s dynastic rule in the Central African oil producer had created widespread discontent, with critics saying the Bongos did little to share Gabon’s wealth with its 2.3 million people. The coup was greeted with scenes of jubilation in the capital, Libreville, and the military government moved quickly to consolidate power,swearing inGeneral Brice Oligui Nguema, head of an elite squad and cousin to Bongo, as interim president."

In July, the 34-year-old had said he wasretiringfrom international cricket butreversed his decisiona day later after meeting with the country’s prime minister. Bangladesh were the last of the10 participating nationsto name their squad, amid speculations over Tamim’s fitness and the team’s captaincy. Selectors confirmed that all-rounder Shakib al-Hasan will continue to lead the squad.  Tamim’s persistent back injury forced him to step down as the team’s 50-overs captain and he then missed theAsia Cup. “Due to his back injury, we had to leave him out from the squad,” said Minhajul Abedin, the chairman of the national team selection panel. “The decision was taken after consulting with every stakeholder, like the team management which includes captain and head coach and the medical team. It is understood his pain could be back any time so we can’t take a risk with him.” Tamim returned for this month’s home series against New Zealand but complained of discomfort, prompting team management to leave him out of the 15-man World Cup squad. Tamim has scored 8,357 ODI runs – the most by a Bangladesh batter – in his 243 appearances. Bangladesh will play two warm-up matches before their tournament opener against Afghanistan on October 7.

Here are the key take­aways from Trump’s fraud rul­ing,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/key-takeaways-from-donald-trumps-new-york-fraud-ruling,"A judge rules that Trump fraud­u­lent­ly in­flat­ed the val­ue of his prop­er­ties, in­clud­ing his Mar-a-Lago es­tate.","New York Judge Arthur Engoron has ruled that former United States PresidentDonald Trump committed fraudfor years while building his real estate empire. The ruling came on Tuesday in a civil lawsuit brought by New York’s attorney general, Letitia James. James, a Democrat, sued Trump and the Trump Organization a year ago, accusing them of fraudulently overvaluing the real estate company’s assets, including skyscrapers, golf courses and his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Here are the key takeaways from the ruling: Engoron found that Trump consistently overvalued Mar-a-Lago, inflating its value on one financial statement by as much as 2,300 percent. Trump also lied about the size of his Manhattan apartment. He claimed his three-storey Trump Tower penthouse was nearly three times its actual size, valuing it at $327m. No apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount, James said.  Engoron also found that Trump, his company and key executives repeatedly lied on annual financial statements, reaping rewards such as favourable loan terms and lower insurance premiums. Those tactics crossed a line and violated the law, the judge said, rejecting Trump’s contention that a disclaimer on the financial statements absolved him of any wrongdoing. In his 35-page ruling, Engoron wrote that Trump did not make distinctions between the worth of rent regulated and unregulated apartments or restricted and unrestricted land. James has sought a ban on Trump and his three eldest children from running a company based in New York again. Additionally, she is seeking $250m which she said is the estimated worth of benefits derived from the alleged fraud. The judge ordered that some of Trump’s business licences be rescinded as punishment, making it difficult or impossible for them to do business in New York, and said he would continue to have an independent monitor oversee Trump Organization operations. If the order is not successfully appealed, Trump will lose the authority to make strategic and financial decisions over some of his key properties in the state. The Trump Foundation charity was shut down.  Trump’s lawyers had asked the judge to throw out the case, which he refused. They contend that James was not legally allowed to file the lawsuit because there is no evidence the public was harmed by Trump’s actions. They argued that several allegations in the lawsuit were barred by the statute of limitations. Engoron, noting that he had emphatically rejected those arguments earlier in the case, equated them to the “time loop in the film Groundhog Day”. He fined five defence lawyers $7,500 each as punishment for engaging in repetitive arguments, but denied James’s request to sanction Trump and other defendants. Trump made a series of statements against the decision, calling it “un-American” and part of an ongoing plot to damage his campaign to return to the White House. “My Civil Rights have been violated, and some Appellate Court, whether federal or state, must reverse this horrible, un-American decision,” he wrote on his Truth Social site. Trump’s lawyer, Christopher Kise, said they would appeal, calling the decision “completely disconnected from the facts and governing law”. Engoron’s ruling – which comes in a phase of the case known as summary judgement – resolves the key claim in James’s lawsuit, but six others remain. Engoron is slated to hold a non-jury trial starting October 2, before deciding on those claims and any punishments he may impose. The trial could last into December, Engoron has said."

The Nigerian striker’s agent Roberto Calenda released a statement on X, formerly Twitter, saying the video caused “very serious damage to the player”. “What happened today on Napoli’s official profile on the TikTok platform is not acceptable. A video mocking Victor was first made public and then, but now belatedly, deleted,” Calenda said in the statement on Tuesday. “We reserve the right to take legal action and any other useful initiative to protect Victor.” Osimhen missed a late penalty in a goalless draw against Bologna in Serie A on Sunday and the video featured a clip of the striker’s penalty miss with an odd, sped-up voice dubbed over the top.  Last season, Osimhenhelped the Italian teamsecure a first league title, the club’s first in three decades, by scoring 31 goals across all competitions. The strange social media clip comes after there appeared to be tension between Osimhen and Napoli manager Rudi Garcia during the game. The 24-year-old striker was seen berating Garcia as he was substituted with four minutes remaining of the goalless draw. After the match, Garcia told reporters: “Even the greatest players in the history of football miss penalties. As for when he went off, we talked about that, what I say to my players remains in the locker room.” Osimhen, who captured the interest of Manchester United this summer, did not agree to sign a new contract with the Italian team. Champions Napoliare seventh in the standings and play Udinese at home on Wednesday."

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last week said Ottawa hadcredible intelligencelinking Indian agents to the murder, prompting an angry initial reaction from New Delhi, which denies the allegation. Asked about the allegation at a Council on Foreign Relations event in New York, India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, on Tuesday detailed New Delhi’s response in diplomatic engagements. “One, we told the Canadians that this is not the government of India’s policy,” he said. “Two, we told the Canadians saying that look, if you have something specific, if you have something relevant, you know, let us know – we are open to looking at it.” India last week suspended new visas for Canadians and asked Ottawa to reduce its diplomatic presence in the country, citing what it called a deterioratingsecurity environment. India had been “badgering the Canadians” about its claims that organised criminals are based there, a reference to separatists like Nijjar, Jaishankar said, adding that India had made “a large number of extradition requests”. “The picture is not complete without the context,” he added. “You also have to appreciate that in the last few years, Canada actually has seen a lot of organised crime, you know, relating to, you know, the secessionist forces, organised crime, violence, extremism, they are all very, very deeply mixed up. “Our concern is that it’s really been very permissive because of political reasons,” he added. “We have a situation where actually our diplomats are threatened, our consulates have been attacked and often comments are made [that are] interference in our politics,” he said. Canada is home to some 770,000 Sikhs, or about two percent of the country’s population, with a vocal group voicing support for creating aseparate state of Khalistan. Allies of Canada, including the United States, havecautiously expressed concernover Canada’s claims and urged India to cooperate with Canada’s investigation. The US ambassador to Canada told Canadian television that some information on the case had been gathered by theFive Eyes intelligencealliance, which includes the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. As US President Joe Biden looks to spotlight his foreign policy chops with his 2024 re-election bid heating up, he is facing a growing list of national security headaches, including the diplomatic spat between Canada and India over the killing of the Sikh activist on Canadian soil. Some legislators in the US from the opposition Democrats have expressed concern over Nijjar’s killing and demanded the US administration should support the Canadian investigation.  “We are also requesting a briefing on whether there are similar operations in the United States,” Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said in a post on X on Tuesday."

Nepal bludgeoned 314 for three in their 20 overs in Hangzhou on Wednesday, surpassing the previous highest of 278 for three by Afghanistan against Ireland in 2019. Kushal Malla, batting at number three, led the way, cracking the fastest T20 international century – off just 34 balls. He was followed by Dipendra Singh Airee, who finished the innings in ridiculous fashion against the hapless Mongolian bowlers, hitting eight sixes in an unbeaten 52 off just 10 balls. He reached his 50 off nine balls, another world record, beating India’s Yuvraj Singh’s 2007 effort against England which took 12 balls. Mongolia, whose women’s team were bowled out for just 15 last week in the Asian Games, were dismissed for only 41. When Malla came in to bat, Nepal were 42 for one in 4.5 overs. His 50-ball 137, along with Airee and Paudel’s fifties, saw them score 272 runs in 15 overs by the end of Nepal’s innings. He smashed 12 sixes and eight fours at a strike rate of 274 and also became the second youngest batter to score a century in men’s T20Is at the age of 19 years and 206 days. The previous record of the quickest T20 century was held by South Africa’s David Miller, who scored it in 35 balls against Bangladesh in 2017.

The one-day international (ODI) cricket tournament has been held every four years since 1975. In the opening match, New Zealand will take on defending champions England at the 132,000-capacity Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Here is everything you need to know about the 46-day tournament: A total of 48 matches will be played in 10 cities across India. Each stadium will host five matches, except the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad, which will host only three games. The Narendra Modi Stadium (formerly known as Motera Stadium) in Ahmedabad is the largest cricket stadium in the world, with a capacity to seat 132,000 spectators. It will host the opening match as well as the final on November 19. The two semifinals will be held in Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai, and Eden Gardens, Kolkata. Other hosting cities include Hyderabad, Dharamsala, New Delhi, Chennai, Lucknow, Pune, and Bengaluru. Ten teams will take part in the tournament: Previously, qualification to the World Cup depended on ODI rankings. However, this year the qualification process involved a series of matches played between 2020 and 2023. Notably missing for the first time in the tournament’s history are the 1975 and 1979 champions, the West Indies, after they lost to Scotland in a pivotal qualifying clash. The Netherlands secured the last qualification spot, marking their return to the tournament for the first time since 2011, edging out Scotland. The inaugural Cricket World Cup took place in England in 1975 and was won by the West Indies. The Caribbean squad successfully defended four years later, in 1979, but lost to India in the third edition of the games in 1983. Australia have emerged as the most successful team at the World Cup, clinching victory in five of the 12 tournaments. India and the West Indies have two titles each, while Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and England have each won the World Cup once. England are the defending champions having beaten New Zealand in a nail-biting final held in London in 2019.  The International Cricket Council (ICC) announced that $10m has been allocated for the tournament’s prize money, the same amount as 2019. The winning team will receive $4m, while the runners-up will receive $2m. The two other semifinalists will get $800,000 each. The remaining six teams will receive $100,000 each for participating in the tournament. An additional $40,000 will be paid out to the winners of every match during the group stage. "

An Apple Store was hit at about 8pm local time on Tuesday (00:00 GMT) and police chased fleeing teenagers who raided the shop, recovering dropped iPhones and a “pile of iPads” at one spot, a police statement said. More than 100 people who appeared to be teenagers looted a Lululemon store, NBC10 Philadelphia reported, citing a police officer. Video posted on social media showed mostly masked youths in hoodies running out of Lululemon and police officers grabbing several and tackling them to the sidewalk, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. No injuries were immediately reported but CBS Philadelphia said a security guard was assaulted at a Foot Locker outlet.  The Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper reported that more than 20 people were arrested, many of whom were young people, during the theft and vandalism spree on Tuesday night. According to the Inquirer, the city’s acting police commissioner John Stanford said the young people involved appeared to have coordinated the raids using social media and “a caravan of cars” was moving around locations in the city and breaking into shops. The raids appeared to have been contained by police by midnight local time, the newspaper added.  The flash mob-style ransacking followed an earlier peaceful protest in the city over a judge’s decision on Tuesday to dismiss murder and other charges against a Philadelphia police officer who shot dead a driver, Eddie Irizarry, through a car window. Several police commanders said the looting was not connected to earlier demonstrations over the judge’s decision, CBS Philadelphia reported. “This had nothing to do with the protests,” acting police chief Stanford said, according to the Inquirer. “What we had tonight was a bunch of criminal opportunists take advantage of a situation and try to destroy our city,” he said. The shop raids occurred on the same day that US budget retailer Target announced it would close nine stores in four states, including one in New York’s East Harlem neighbourhood, and three in the San Francisco Bay Area, saying that theft and organised retail crime have threatened the safety of its workers and customers."

Last week, Canadian Prime Minister Justin TrudeauaccusedIndia of playing a role in the killing of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was shot dead in June in British Columbia state. The Indian government has dismissed Ottawa’s allegations as “absurd”. In this infographic series, Al Jazeera takes a look at the movement and its origins. Khalistan is the name of the proposed state envisioned by some Sikhs, incorporating the Indian state of Punjab as well as other Punjabi-speaking areas of northern India to establish a Sikh nation. The ethno-religious liberation movement gained traction in the 1970s and early 80s in India. It later died down but has developed momentum among the Sikh diaspora in recent years.  There is division among supporters of Khalistan on the boundaries of a sovereign Sikh state, but most agree that it would encompass the state of Punjab in India. The historical Punjab region is located in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent and includes modern-day eastern Pakistan and northwestern India. In India, it includes cities like Ludhiana, Amritsar, Chandigarh and Jalandhar; and Lahore, Faisalabad, Nankana Sahib, Rawalpindi and Multan in Pakistan.  Some Khalistan supporters have called for the incorporation of the Pakistani side of Punjab, while other groups argue that some areas of Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, states surrounding India’s Punjab, should also form part of the proposed nation. According to the 2011 Indian census, the last when it was held, there are about 20.8 million Sikhs, making up 1.7 percent of the country’s population. The majority of Sikhs, about 16 million at the time of the census, live in the northern state of Punjab where they make up about 58 percent of the state’s population.  The notion of Khalistan is rooted in Sikhism, a faith that arose during the 15th century when northern India was under Mughal rule. Led by Guru Gobind Singh, the faith was recast in 1699 under Khalsa, a word derived from Arabic meaning pure, to incorporate a political vision to protect Sikhs and other religions from religious persecution and to establish Sikh rule. Following the partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947, the Punjabi Suba movement emerged which called for the establishment of a Punjabi-speaking autonomous Sikh state. In 1952, the then-Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru declared he would suppress the demand for a Punjabi-speaking state, leading to divisions between Sikhs and Hindus. Ultimately, in 1966, the state of Punjab was created with Chandigarh as its capital. In the 1970s and 80s, following for the Khalistan movement re-emerged among Sikhs in India and the diaspora. Spurred by the Sikh rebel leader, Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, the movement became an armed rebellion. The rebellion lasted more than a decade and was suppressed by a violent crackdown by the Indian government, in which thousands of people were killed, including prominent Sikh leaders. In 1984, Indian forces stormed the Golden Temple, Sikhism’s holiest site, in Amritsar, Punjab to flush out separatists who had taken refuge there. The operation killed about 400 people, according to official Indian government figures, but Sikh groups say thousands were killed. The dead included Bhindranwale, whom the Indian government accused of leading the armed rebellion. On October 31, 1984, then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who had ordered the raid on the temple, was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards. Her deathtriggereda series of anti-Sikh riots, in which Hindu mobs went from house to house across northern India, particularly New Delhi, pulling Sikhs from their homes, hacking many to death and burning others alive. The following year, on June 23, 1985, a bomb exploded on Air India Flight 182 over the Atlantic Ocean, killing all 329 people on board. An investigation into the bombing revealed that it was orchestrated by Canadian-based Sikh fighters as revenge for the Golden Temple operation. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has intensified the pursuit of Sikh separatists and arrested dozens of leaders from various outfits allegedly linked to the movement. Hartosh Bal, executive editor of The Caravan magazine in India,told Al Jazeerathe Sikh separatist movement has been non-existent for decades in India. “The Khalistan movement has a long history, and during the 1980s, there was a violent military movement on Indian soil. But ever since – at least in India, in the state of Punjab, where the Sikhs are the majority – the Khalistan movement has been virtually non-existent, enjoys no political support and goes up and down depending on the attention the Indian government pays to it,” Bal said. “But the Modi government has consistently hyped up the Khalistani threat to India. I think, again, because it suits them domestically to talk about security threats to the Indian nation, rather than the actual measure of threat on the ground from the movement.” The Khalistan movement has seen some support in diaspora Sikh communities, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia. There are an estimated 26 million Sikhs around the world, according to the London School of Economics(LSE). Canada has the largest Sikh community outside India, with about 770,000 people having reported their religion as Sikh in the 2021 census. According to the 2021 census in Egland and Wales, about 524,000 Sikhs are living in both countries. About 210,000 live in Australia, according to its 2021 census. While the US census does not record religion, it is estimated that there are anywhere between 200,000 to 500,000 Sikhs in the country. In the past three years, Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) has organised unofficial referendums on the establishment of Khalistan in a number of countries. In Australia the vote, held in January, led to clashes between pro-Khalistan and Hindu supporters.  India has requested that Canada, Australia and the UK take legal action against Sikh activists, especially in Canada where Sikhs account for nearly 2 percent of the country’s population. Following the arrest of Amritpal Singh, a 30-year-old separatist leader who had revived calls for Khalistan, protesters in London pulled down the Indian flag from the high commission and smashed the windows of the building. New Delhi also accused Khalistan supporters of attacking India’s High Commission in Ottawa and its other offices earlier this year, as well as of vandalising Hindu temples. Hardeep Singh Nijjar On June 18, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, 45, was shot dead outside a Sikh gurdwara in Surrey, a Vancouver suburb with a large Sikh population, three years after India had designated him a “terrorist”. Nijjar supported the demand for a Sikh homeland and was reportedly organising an unofficial referendum in India for an independent Sikh nation at the time of his death. Nijjar was born in 1977 in Punjab’s Jalandhar district and he moved to Canada in 1997. He was initially associated with the Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) Sikh separatist group, according to India’s counterterrorism National Investigation Agency. New Delhi has listed BKI as a “terrorist organisation” and says it is funded by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency, a charge Islamabad denies.  Avtar Singh Khanda In June, Avtar Singh Khanda, 35, the alleged head of the Khalistan Liberation Force and aide toAmritpal Singh, died in the UK, following a diagnosis of terminal cancer. But the circumstances of his death were described as “mysterious”, with some attributing his demise to poisoning. His funeral was attended by thousands. However, his mother and sister living in India were denied visas to attend the funeral by the UK Home Office. Paramjit Singh Panjwar Paramjit Singh Panjwar, 63, was the alleged head of the Khalistan Commando Force (KCF), a Sikh Khalistani armed organisation operating in Punjab. Panjwar was gunned down in Lahore, Pakistan by two unidentified gunmen in May this year. Panjwar played a significant role in the Sikh rebellion in India during the 1980s and 90s. He was known for his involvement in numerous acts of political violence, with the Indian government making extensive efforts to capture him. Harmeet Singh In January 2020, the alleged leader of the Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF), Harmeet Singh 38, was killed near Lahore, Pakistan. He was succeeded by Avtar Singh Khanda, who took over as the KLF leader in 2020, according to reports. Singh was accused of murders in India and training fighters for the Khalistan movement. Following Trudeau’sclaimsthat India had a role in the killing of Nijjar, tensions between Canada and India have escalated. India suspended issuing visas to Canadian citizens amid the escalation, citing “security threats” disrupting work at its missions in Canada. Also, in a tit-for-tat move, India expelled one of the top Canadian diplomats last week after Canada’s foreign minister expelled Pavan Kumar Rai, the most senior member of India’s foreign intelligence agency operating in Canada.

There have also been land exercises on the closest part of China’s eastern coast to the island, according to Taipei. Asked at a regular news briefing in Beijing about the Chinese drills, the country’s Taiwan Affairs Office spokeswoman Zhu Fenglian said China’s People’s Liberation Army had carried out a “series” of drills. “The purpose is to resolutely combat the arrogance of Taiwan independence separatist forces and their actions to seek independence,” Zhu said. “The provocation of Taiwan independence continues all day long and the actions of the People’s Liberation Army to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity are always ongoing,” she added. China’s army has not explicitly mentioned or commented on the drills. Taiwan’s government says only the island’s people can decide their future and has repeatedly offered talks with China, which Beijing has rejected. On Wednesday, Taiwan’s defence ministry reported more Chinese military activity, saying that in the previous 24 hours, it had detected and responded to 16 Chinese aircraft entering the island’s air defence identification zone. Of those, 12 crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, which had served as an unofficial barrier between the two sides until China began regularly crossing it in August last year. On Thursday, Taiwan is due to launch the first of eightdomestically-made submarinesas part of its plans to bolster defences against China. Asked about the submarines, Zhu claimed efforts by the DPP to “seek independence with force” would only exacerbate tensions and “push the Taiwanese people into a dangerous situation”. Taiwan has said it needs tomodernise its militaryto better defend itself from an attack by Beijing. The new submarines will rejuvenate a fleet that currently consists of two World War II-era vessels and two Dutch-made submarines built in the 1980s. Taiwan’s defence ministry last week took the unusual step of announcing it was monitoring Chinese drills in Fujian province, opposite Taiwan."

NASA said on Tuesday that researchers discovered “dust and debris on the avionics deck of theOsiris-REx science canisterwhen the initial lid was removed today”. The space agency did not specify whether the materials discovered on opening the lid of the probe definitely belonged to the asteroid, though NASA said on social media that “scientists gasped as the lid was lifted from the [Osiris-REx] asteroid sample return canister”. “A scientific treasure box,” NASA Astromaterials said in a social media post. “Dark powder and sand-sized particles” were found on “the inside of the lid and base”, NASA said.  The residue on the avionics deck found on Tuesday was likely a result of issues during the collection phase of the space mission, which NASA said were eventually solved, allowing for the secure transfer of the sample from the asteroid to the probe’s storage canister. The probe’s lid was opened in an airtight chamber at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. “The aluminium lid was removed inside a glovebox designed to enable working with the large piece of hardware,”NASA said in a statement, accompanied by images shared on social media showing scientists in full protective wear working with the probe sitting inside a reinforced glass and steel box. NASA scientists are now waiting eagerly to begin analysing the bulk of the samplescooped from the asteroid, which will require “intricate disassembly” of the probe, the space agency said.  A news conference is scheduled for October 11 during which information about the bulk of the sample will be revealed to the public. The robotic spacecraftOSIRIS-REx was launchedin 2016 and collected its specimen three years ago from Bennu, a small, carbon-rich asteroid discovered in 1999, which is classified as a “near-Earth object” because it passes relatively close to our planet every six years. The retrieval marked only the third asteroid sample, and by far the biggest, ever returned to Earth for analysis, following two similar missions by Japan’s space agency ending in 2010 and 2020. Landing on the asteroid, Osiris-Rex collected roughly 250 grams (9 ounces) of dust from its rocky surface. Analysis of the material taken from the asteroid, scientists believe, will help researchers better understand the formation of the solar system and how Earth became habitable. NASA said the sample will also “help us better understand the types of asteroids that could threaten Earth”. Though the odds of Bennu hitting the Earth are considered remote, such a possibility has not been ruled out.  Roughly one-quarter of the Bennu sample will be immediately used in experiments and a small amount will be sent to mission partners in Japan and Canada, while the remainder will be conserved for study by future generations. The space probe ended its 6.21-billion-kilometre journey (3.86-billion-mile) after parachuting down in the desert in the western state of Utah on Sunday, following a fiery descent through Earth’s atmosphere.

As many as 12 bod­ies found strewn around Mon­ter­rey in north­ern Mex­i­co,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/as-many-as-12-bodies-found-strewn-around-monterrey-in-northern-mexico,Au­thor­i­ties sus­pect drug car­tel con­flict af­ter sev­en bod­ies and five bags of body parts dis­cov­ered in city and sub­urbs.,"Mutilated corpses and severed body parts have been found dumped in seven locations across the northern Mexican city of Monterrey and its suburbs, including some of the wealthiest districts in the country. Authorities said on Tuesday they were still analysing the dismembered body parts to try and identify the number of people who had been killed. They confirmed at least seven bodies had been found as well as five bags of body parts, some of which were discovered in cooler boxes. Messages had also been left on the remains, and local media reported there could be as many as 12 victims. Gerardo Palacios, the head security official for Nuevo Leon state, said the killings appeared to be related to an internal dispute within a drug cartel based in neighbouring Tamaulipas. TheGulfandNortheastcartels operate there but he did not specify the group he was referring to. “What we see here is an internal purge within an organised crime group based in Tamaulipas, because of some acts of disloyalty within the group,” Palacios said. Drug cartels in Mexico often leave dismembered bodies on streets, commonly with banners threatening officials or rival gangs. The grisly discoveries recalled the 2010s when the city was engulfed in aviolent turf warbetween drug cartels and bodies were left in the streets or hanging from bridges. Monterrey has since evolved into an industrial powerhouse and officials have been wooing foreign investors, including electric car giant Tesla. Mexico has recorded more than 420,000 murders — most of them blamed on organised crime — since the launch of a controversial military operation to combat drug trafficking in 2006. Photos of the supposed messages circulating in the local press and on social media suggested the Northeast Cartel had carried out the murders as retribution for alleged infiltration of the group. The attorney general’s office did not confirm the authenticity of the photos."

How a Chi­na deal put the homes of thou­sands of In­done­sians at risk,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/how-a-china-deal-put-the-homes-of-thousands-of-indonesians-at-risk,Res­i­dents of Rem­pang Is­land have un­til Sep­tem­ber 28 to leave their vil­lages to make way for a sprawl­ing eco­nom­ic zone.,"Rempang, Indonesia–Some 7,500 peoplefrom the Indonesian island of Rempang face a September 28 deadline to leave their homes to make way for a sprawling Eco City with a giant Chinese-owned glass factory as its showpiece. Indonesia’s Investment Minister Bahlil Lahadalia has said that the project will create some 35,000 jobs and pull in some $26.6bn in investment by 2080, but local residents are sceptical. They say the development threatens their way of life by moving them to new homes far from their traditional fishing community. In recent weeks,tensions have flaredon Rempang and neighbouring islands, including Batam, as islanders opposed to the development have clashed with local police. Here is all you need to know about the controversial project. The glass factory will be part of what is known as Rempang Eco-City – a joint project between the Batam Indonesia Free Zone Authority (BP Batam), local Indonesian company PT Makmur Elok Graha (MEG) and China’s Xinyi Glass – the world’s largest producer of glass and solar panels. Xinyi Glass has pledged some $11.6bn for the factory. Once completed, the plant will be the second-largest of its kind in the world. The wider Eco-City project will cover some 17,000 hectares (42,000 acres) of land and is supposed to develop industrial, service and tourism areas on Rempang Island. In July this year, Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo, better known as Jokowi, travelled to China to meet President Xi Jinping and discuss a range of strategic partnership opportunities between the two countries, including health, education, language and investment initiatives. As part of the two-day trip, Jokowi discussed two further key projects: investment in Indonesia’s new capital city in East Kalimantan and the development of Rempang Island. On July 27, during a meeting with the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce in China at the Shangri-La Hotel in Chengdu, Jokowi said the Indonesian government had prepared some 34,000 hectares (84,000 acres) of land in the new capital city for Chinese investment. The next day, a delegation including Jokowi witnessed the signing of several cooperation documents covering the development of the glass and solar panel industry on Rempang. Accompanying the president at the meeting were the Coordinating Minister for Human Development and Cultural Affairs Muhadjir Effendy, Coordinating Minister for Maritime and Investment Affairs Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, Minister of Foreign Affairs Retno Marsudi, Minister of Investment Bahlil Lahadalia and Indonesia’s Ambassador to China Djauhari Oratmangun. To some observers, the meeting was notable not for who was there but who was not – Defence MinisterPrabowo Subianto– who has often taken a firm line on foreign investment in Indonesia, particularly in relation to China. “Given the strategic implications of this project and its proximity to Singapore and Malaysia, one wonders what Indonesia’s defence establishment thinks of this project. How much, for instance, was the defence ministry and Prabowo involved in planning for this project?” said Jacqui Baker, a fellow at the Indo-Pacific Research Centre at Australia’s Murdoch University. Batam is less than an hour by ferry south of Singapore. It was the setting for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) firstjoint military drillsearlier this month. “Prabowo is currently running as a presidential candidate and actively seeking the presidential endorsement, yet his classic stump speech is ultra-nationalistic, emphasising how great powers are trying to undercut Indonesia and its people,” Baker added. In 2022, trade between Indonesia and China was valued at more than $133bn, making the country Indonesia’s biggest trading partner ahead of Singapore, Japan and the United States. The archipelago is home to dozens of infrastructure projects carried out under China’s Belt and Road Initiative – a global infrastructure development plan launched by Xi a decade ago. Indonesia’s president has also rolled out a range of other ambitious development projects and goals across the country with the aim of raising Indonesia’s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita to $25,000 by 2045. In that sense, the deal with Xinyi Glass is unsurprising to observers. “With China, it is easier and more efficient to secure investment because Chinese state-owned enterprises (SEOs) dare to inject capital into Indonesia,” Trissia Wijaya, a senior research fellow at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, Japan, told Al Jazeera. “In China, the players are Chinese state-owned companies who are brave enough to take the debt-to-equity ratio as high as possible. Meanwhile, Japan and Taiwan are all private companies that emphasise efficiency. With US companies, their way of working is more geo-strategic, which would not fit into Jokowi’s pragmatic approach in dealing with ‘getting things done’.” Wijaya said she sees “no reason” for Indonesia to oppose a project like Rempang. After Jokowi’s meeting in China, Rempang Eco City was named a “National Strategic Project” in official documents dated August 28. To improve Indonesia’s productivity and global competitiveness, the government wants to develop the country’s infrastructure including railways, ports, roads and airports, as well as industrial development zones. Some 245 projects, including the China-backedhigh-speed railway from Jakarta to Bandung, have been designated National Strategic Projects. Such projects fall under the purview of the president and, because they are considered nationally important, the authorities have the power to seize land for their construction, even if it means residents have to move. According to the Indonesian finance ministry’s website, “An infrastructure development project will be a National Strategic Project with the consideration that the project is considered strategic and important to be completed in a short time and has a goal to increase growth and equitable development in order to improve the welfare of society and regional development.” Local officials in Batam told Al Jazeera that the original plan for Rempang was vastly different from the new glass factory and Eco-City the government is now pushing through. Taba Iskander, who was the head of Batam’s Regional People’s Legislative Council in 2004, told Al Jazeera that, at that time, the regional government signed a Memorandum of Understanding to develop no more than 5,000 hectares (12,300 acres) of Rempang Island as part of a project to focus on the tourism industry in partnership with PT MEG. “PT MEG was given five years to prepare the Rempang area and given a temporary location on the island. However, as of 2022, PT MEG did not carry out any activities or development in the area,” he said. Under the 2004 agreement, which Al Jazeera has seen, the “old villages and cultural heritage of Rempang would be maintained and preserved”. That commitment was abandoned when Rempang was named a National Strategic Project, Iskander said, describing the latest proposals as “very different” from what was originally envisaged. “The current project wants to relocate the old villages and the Malay community on Rempang Island,” he said. Rempang Island has a strategically important location. It is close to both neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore and encircled by several smaller local islands. Boy Sembiring, the head of the Indonesian Forum for Environment for Riau, said that it was probably chosen precisely for these reasons. “Rempang is surrounded by small islands and sea which contains silica sand and quartz sand which are raw materials for making glass and solar panels,” he said. He added that this was likely to come at great cost to the environment. Other parts of the Riau Islands Province, including Karimun, which has been mined forsand exports to Singapore, have already suffered severe degradation. “The presence of the glass factory not only threatens Rempang but also the small islands around it. If this company is particularly active, we predict that it is likely that there will be many mining sites developed on neighbouring islands that threaten local fishers’ fishing areas and the safety of those small islands,” Sembiring said. Residents, many of whom have lived on Rempang for generations, were told only at the beginning of the month that they would need to leave their homes by September 28. Many have told Al Jazeera that they do not want to leave. Some have joined mass protests against the project, braving police tear gas and water cannons. The government has said it will provide them with new houses in Batam valued at $7,800 with a land area of 500 square metres (5,382 sq ft). But as the buildings remain under construction, the families will first have to move to temporary accommodation (their rent will be paid by the government). Nor, a snack seller at a local school on Rempang Island, has lived there for 50 years and said she was fearful of the relocation plans. She wants the president to intervene. Jokowi promised back in 2019, as he campaigned for a second term in office, to secure the Rempang residents’ official land ownership certificates. “I would say to Jokowi, ‘Please Sir, protect our land. How would you feel if this was your home? You don’t need to build the factory here, please think of our children’,” Nor said. “We don’t want to move.”"

US Sen­ate an­nounces stop­gap mea­sure to avert im­pend­ing gov­ern­ment shut­down,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/26/us-senate-announces-stopgap-measure-to-avert-impending-government-shutdown,"Re­pub­li­cans and De­moc­rats have agreed to a deal for six weeks of short-term fund­ing, but it faces hur­dles in the House.","Leaders in the United States Senate have agreed to a stopgap measure designed to prevent an imminentgovernment shutdownover budget legislation. The deal, hashed out between Republicans and Democrats, wouldkeep the government openfor six additional weeks. It would also earmark approximately $6bn in short-term funding for Ukraine as it fends off a Russian invasion. But should the deal pass the full Senate, it will likely face significant hurdles in the House of Representatives, wherefar-right Republicanshave promised to shoot it down if it reaches the floor. Seeming to anticipate criticism from the hardline flank of his party, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell defended the short-term solution in a speech on Tuesday. “Delaying action on short-term government funding doesn’t advance the ball on any policy priorities,” the Republican senator said. “Shutting the government down over a domestic government dispute doesn’t strengthen anyone’s political position. It just puts important progress on ice, and it leaves millions of Americans on edge.”  The US government is less than five days away from its deadline to pass budget legislation at midnight on September 30 (04:00 GMT on Sunday). Should it fail to do so, much of the government will stop all non-essential functions, leaving federal services in limbo and millions of employees without their paycheques. That prospect could also furtherdent the US’s credit rating, thereby forcing the government to pay higher interest rates. Already, in August, one of the major credit ratings agencies,Fitch Ratings, downgraded the US’s score from AAA — the highest — to AA+, citing a “steady deterioration in standards of governance”. Analysts with another credit agency, Moody’s, issued a warning on Monday that it could follow suit if the budget standoff is not resolved. But Republicans, particularly on the far-right, have baulked at current levels of government spending, calling for stiff cuts to expenditures likeaid for Ukraine. “This will certainly lead to a government shutdown,” Republican Senator JD Vance of Ohiosaidin response to the $6bn for Ukraine in the stopgap proposal. If the stopgap measure passes the full Senate in the coming days, as is expected, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy — the top Republican in the lower chamber — can choose to bring the legislation to the floor. But he faces a split party, with some in the far-right threatening to remove him from his leadership position if he partners with Democrats to pass budget legislation. When asked by reporters on Tuesday whether he felt his speakership was on the line, McCarthy issued a punchyresponse. “Oh man, that should make me worried, huh?” McCarthy said theatrically. “It’s the same thing you asked me before I got elected speaker. I’m not worried about whether there’s a speakership place or not. The only thing I care about is fighting for the American people.” In January, it took McCarthy five days and a historic15 rounds of votingto gain the speakership, amid staunch opposition from the far-right. But in his remarks, McCarthy embraced some of the priorities espoused by far-right members of his party. He told reporters he felt aid to Ukraine and the stopgap funding for the government should be “two separate things”. The Republican speaker also called on Democrats to instead invest in more security along the US’s southern border. “I don’t think Ukraine aid should be taken up in the supplemental,” McCarthy said. “I don’t quite understand, when you have all these people across the country talking about the challenges happening in America today, that people would go and say, ‘Oh we need to do Ukraine and ignore what’s happening along our border.’ I think that would be the wrong approach.” Republicans hold a very narrow 221-member majority in the House, out of 435 seats. That means McCarthy would either need to pass bipartisan legislation to avert a government shutdown — or rally nearly every member of his party. In avideo statementon Tuesday, Democratic President Joe Biden, a frequent target of conservative complaints over budgeting, accused “a small group of extreme House Republicans” of attempting to shut down the government to further their priorities. “I’m prepared to do my part but Republicans in the House of Representatives refuse,” he said. “They refuse to stand up to the extremists in their party. So now, everyone in America could be forced to pay the price.” The Senate recessed on Tuesday after a procedural vote to advance the stopgap deal concluded with overwhelming support: There were 77 votes in favour of starting work on the bill, and only 19 against. “The only solution for avoiding a harmful government shutdown is bipartisanship,” Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said on Tuesday, counting the dwindling number of days until the potential shutdown. “We are now right at the precipice.”"
Fu­ner­als held as at least 113 killed in Iraq wed­ding fire,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/26/at-least-100-killed-in-fire-at-wedding-celebration-in-iraq-media-report,Ini­tial re­ports in­di­cate that fire­works used dur­ing wed­ding cer­e­mo­ny may have been re­spon­si­ble for blaze.,"At least 113 people have been killed and more than150 injuredin a fire that ripped through a wedding celebration in Iraq’s northern Nineveh province, local officials and emergency services said. Nineveh Deputy Governor Hassan al-Allaq confirmed the death toll, which may yet rise. The fire was reported to have started at approximately 10:45pm local time (19:45 GMT) on Tuesday night. The fire engulfed a wedding hall in Nineveh’s Hamdaniya district, where the celebration was taking place. Hamdaniya, also known as Qaraqosh, is a majority Christian town, and is located outside of the northern city of Mosul, some 400km (about 250 miles) northwest of the capital Baghdad. “All efforts are being made to provide relief to those affected by the unfortunate accident,” Iraq’s health ministry spokesman Saif al-Badr said. On Wednesday, funerals were already taking place for the victims of the fire, as mourning relatives gathered outside a morgue in Mosul. “This was not a wedding. This was hell,” said Mariam Khedr, crying and hitting herself as she waited for officials to return the bodies of her daughter Rana Yakoub, 27, and three young grandchildren, the youngest aged just eight months. Iraq’s civil defence said initial reports indicated that fireworks may have been the cause of the fire. “Preliminary information indicates that fireworks were used during a wedding, which triggered a fire in the hall,” civil defence authorities said in a statement early on Wednesday. Al Jazeera’s Mahmoud Abdelwahed, reporting from Baghdad, said that fireworks are a common feature of wedding celebrations in Iraq and that some 1,000 people were reported to have been present at the celebration when the fire broke out. Flammable material used in the construction of the event hall is suspected to have contributed to the huge blaze, Abdelwahed said, adding that the building did not appear to have “proper safety measures in place”, including emergency exits. Iraq’s civil defence also reported the presence of prefabricated panels at the event hall that were “highly flammable and contravened safety standards”. “The fire caused some parts of the ceiling to fall due to the use of highly flammable, low-cost construction materials,” civil defence authorities said in their statement. The danger was compounded by the “release of toxic gases linked to the combustion of the panels”, which contained plastic. Images from the aftermath of the fire showed emergency workers clambering over rubble and a collapsed roof with twisted and charred metal at the gutted event hall. “We saw the fire pulsating, coming out of the hall. Those who managed got out and those who didn’t got stuck,” said Imad Yohana, a 34-year-old who escaped the inferno. Another woman also lost several members of her family. “I lost my daughter, her husband and their three-year-old. They were all burned. My heart is burning,” a woman said outside the morgue, where bodies lay outside in bags. Iraq’s Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani ordered an investigation into the fire and asked the country’s interior and health ministry officials to provide relief, his office said in a statement online. Iraq’s interior ministry has said that it has issued four arrest warrants for the owners of the wedding hall, state media has reported. The majority of the injured are suffering from burns and asphyxiation, the health ministry’s al-Badr said, adding that there had also been crowd crushes at the scene. Video clips posted on social media and purportedly taken in the moments before the fire takes hold show burning pieces of paneling falling from the ceiling of the hall. Wedding guests are also seen jumping up from tables and attempting to flee to safety. Kurdish television news channel Rudaw later broadcasted video footage apparently shot by a guest at the wedding, which showed fireworks shooting up from the floor and setting a chandelier overhead ablaze, to the horror of those gathered inside. Other footage appeared to show the bride and groom on the dance floor when the fire began, stunned by the sight of the burning debris. Al Jazeera’s Abdelwahed said that the couple are alive, but had suffered burns. Wedding attendee Rania Waad, who sustained a burn to her hand, said that as the bride and groom “were slow dancing, the fireworks started to climb to the ceiling, the whole hall went up in flames”. “We couldn’t see anything,” the 17-year-old said. “We were suffocating; we didn’t know how to get out.” Iraq’s ministry of health said that “medical aid trucks” have been dispatched to Nineveh from Baghdad and other provinces."
US trade com­mis­sion files anti-trust law­suit against on­line re­tail­er Ama­zon,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/26/us-trade-commission-files-anti-trust-lawsuit-against-online-retailer-amazon,"At­tor­neys gen­er­al from 17 states joined the Fed­er­al Trade Com­mis­sion’s suit, which ac­cus­es Ama­zon of harm­ing con­sumers.","The United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed a long-anticipated anti-trust lawsuit againstonline retailer Amazon, accusing the company of harming consumers by stifling competition. Thelawsuit, which was joined by 17 state attorneys general and filed in Amazon’s home state of Washington, follows a four-year investigation. “The FTC and its state partners say Amazon’s actions allow it to stop rivals and sellers from lowering prices, degrade quality for shoppers, overcharge sellers, stifle innovation, and prevent rivals from fairly competing against Amazon,” the FTC said in astatementon Tuesday. In laying out its charges, the FTC alleged that Amazon had engaged in unfair tactics to “illegally maintain its monopoly power” over the industry of online retail. For example, the agency accused Amazon of punishing sellers who offer lower prices elsewhere, burying them “so far down” the website’s search results “that they become effectively invisible”. The FTC also said Amazon forces sellers to use its warehouses and delivery services, inflating costs for both consumers and sellers.  The federal agency asked the court to issue a permanent injunction ordering Amazon to stop its unlawful conduct. “Left unchecked, Amazon will continue its illegal course of conduct to maintain its monopoly power,” the FTC said in its complaint. In response, Amazon said the FTC is “wrong on the facts and the law”. It also accused the federal agency of overreach, saying that instead of fostering competition, the FTC was stifling it. “The practices the FTC is challenging have helped to spur competition and innovation across the retail industry and have produced greater selection, lower prices and faster delivery speeds for Amazon customers,” said David Zapolsky, Amazon’s general counsel, in a statement. In a blog post, Amazon noted that it had 500,000 independent sellers on the platform. “If the FTC gets its way, the result would be fewer products to choose from, higher prices, slower deliveries for consumers, and reduced options for small businesses — the opposite of what antitrust law is designed to do,” Zapolsky said.  Amazon was started in a garage in 1994 and is today worth $1.3 trillion. By some estimates, the company controls as much as 40 percent of the e-commerce market. Tuesday’s legal filing comes on the heels of similarfederal anti-trust lawsuitsagainst Google’s parent company Alphabet and Meta, the social media company that includes Facebook, as President Joe Biden’s administration seeks to rein in what it sees as big-tech monopolies. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, FTC Chair Lina Khan declined to discuss if the agency would ultimately seek to break up Amazon. “At this stage, the focus is more on liability,” she said. While a law student, Khan wrote about Amazon’s dominance in online retailing for The Yale Law Journal. She was also on the staff of a committee in the House of Representatives that wrote a 2020 report which advocated for reining in four US tech giants: Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook. Under Khan’s watch, the FTC has aggressively attempted to blunt the influence of those sprawling tech companies. However, some recent efforts have proven unsuccessful, including bids to block Microsoft’s takeover of the video game maker Activision Blizzard and Meta’s acquisition of the virtual reality startup Within Unlimited.  The latest complaint follows other actions the FTC has taken against Amazon in the past few months. In June, the agency sued the company, alleging it was usingdeceptive practicesto enrol consumers into Amazon Prime and making it challenging for them to cancel their subscriptions. Amazon denied the allegations. In late May, the company alsoagreed to paya $25m civil penalty to settle allegations that it violated a child privacy law and misled parents about data deletion practices on its popular voice assistant Alexa. Critics of the company welcomed the FTC’s latest action. “No corporation has ever centralized this much power across so many crucial sectors. Left unchecked, Amazon’s power to dictate and control threatens the rule of law and our ability to maintain open, democratically governed markets,” said Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, which has pushed for the government to act against Amazon."
"Trump found li­able for de­ceiv­ing busi­ness­es, banks in New York fraud suit",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/26/trump-found-liable-for-deceiving-businesses-banks-in-new-york-fraud-suit,New York At­tor­ney Gen­er­al Leti­tia James is seek­ing a penal­ty of $250m and a ban on Trump do­ing busi­ness in the state.,"A judge has ruled that former United States President Donald Trump committed fraud for years while building the real estate empire that catapulted him to fame. Judge Arthur Engoron, ruling in a civil lawsuit brought by New York’s attorney general, found that the former president and his company deceived banks, insurers and others by massively overvaluing his assets and exaggerating his net worth on paperwork used in making deals and securing financing. Engoron ordered that some of Trump’s business licenses be rescinded as punishment, making it difficult or impossible for them to do business in New York. The judge also said he would continue to have an independent monitor oversee the Trump Organization’s operations. A Trump spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling. Trump has long insisted he did nothing wrong. The decision is the strongest repudiation yet of Trump’s carefully coiffed image as a wealthy and shrewd real estate mogul turned political powerhouse.  Beyond mere bragging about his riches, Trump, his company and key executives repeatedly lied on his annual financial statements, reaping rewards such as favourable loan terms and lower insurance premiums, Engoron found. Those tactics crossed a line and violated the law, the judge said, rejecting Trump’s contention that a disclaimer on the financial statements absolved him of any wrongdoing. “In defendants’ world: rent regulated apartments are worth the same as unregulated apartments; restricted land is worth the same as unrestricted land; restrictions can evaporate into thin air; a disclaimer by one party casting responsibility on another party exonerates the other party’s lies,” Engoron wrote in his 35-page ruling. “That is a fantasy world, not the real world.” Manhattan prosecutors had looked into bringing a criminal case over the same conduct but declined to do so, leaving New York Attorney General Letitia James to sue Trump and seek penalties that could disrupt his and his family’s ability to do business in the state. Engoron’s ruling – which comes in a phase of the case known as summary judgement – resolves the key claim in James’s lawsuit, but six others remain. Engoron is slated to hold a non-jury trial starting October 2 before deciding on those claims and any punishments he may impose. The trial could last into December, Engoron has said. Trump’s lawyers had asked the judge to throw out the case, which he denied. They contend that James was not legally allowed to file the lawsuit because there is no evidence the public was harmed by Trump’s actions. They also argued that many of the allegations in the lawsuit were barred by the statute of limitations. Engoron, noting that he had “emphatically rejected” those arguments earlier in the case, equated them to the “time-loop in the film Groundhog Day”. James, a Democrat, sued Trump and the Trump Organization a year ago, alleging a pattern of duplicity that she dubbed “the art of the steal”, a twist on the title of Trump’s 1987 business memoir The Art of the Deal. The lawsuit accused Trump and his company of routinely inflating the value of assets like skyscrapers, golf courses and his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, padding his bottom line by billions. Among the allegations was that Trump claimed his Trump Tower apartment in Manhattan – a three-story penthouse replete with gold-plated fixtures – was nearly three times its actual size and valued the property at $327m. No apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount, James said. Trump also valued Mar-a-Lago as high as $739 million – more than 10 times a reasonable estimate of its worth. Trump’s figure for the private club and residence was based on the idea that the property could be developed for residential use, but deed terms prohibit that, James said. Trump has denied wrongdoing, arguing in sworn testimony for the case that it did not matter what he put on his financial statements because they have a disclaimer that says they should not be trusted. He told James at the April deposition, “You don’t have a case and you should drop this case.” “Do you know the banks were fully paid? Do you know the banks made a lot of money?” Trump testified. “Do you know I don’t believe I ever got even a default notice, and even during COVID, the banks were all paid? And yet you’re suing on behalf of banks, I guess. It’s crazy. The whole case is crazy.” Engoron rejected that argument when the defence previously sought to have the case thrown out. The judge said the disclaimer on the financial statements “makes abundantly clear that Mr Trump was fully responsible for the information contained within” them. He also said that “allowing blanket disclaimers to insulate liars from liability would completely undercut” the “important function” that such statements serve. James’s lawsuit is one of several legal headaches for Trump as he campaigns for a return to the White House in 2024. He has been indicted four times in the last six months. In two of those indictments – one in Georgia, one in Washington, DC – he stands accused of plotting to overturn his 2020 election loss. In Florida, meanwhile, he has been charged with hoarding classified documents and in Manhattan, he is accused of falsifying business records related to hush money paid on his behalf.  The Trump Organization was convicted of tax fraud last year in an unrelated criminal case for helping executives dodge taxes on extravagant perks such as Manhattan apartments and luxury cars. The company was fined $1.6m. One of the executives, Trump’s longtime finance chief Allen Weisselberg, pleaded guilty and served five months in jail. He is a defendant in James’s lawsuit and gave a sworn deposition testimony for the case in May. James’s lawsuit does not carry the potential of prison time but could complicate Trump’s ability to transact real estate deals. It could also stain his legacy as a developer. James has asked Engoron to ban Trump and his three eldest children from ever again running a company based in New York. She also wants Trump and the Trump Organization barred from entering into commercial real estate acquisitions for five years, among other sanctions. The $250m in penalties she is seeking is the estimated worth of benefits derived from the alleged fraud, she said. James, who campaigned for office as a Trump critic and watchdog, started scrutinising his business practices in March 2019 after his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen testified to Congress that Trump exaggerated his wealth on financial statements provided to Deutsche Bank while trying to obtain financing to buy the NFL’s Buffalo Bills. James’s office previously sued Trump for misusing his charitable foundation to further his political and business interests. Trump was ordered to pay $2m to an array of charities as a fine. The charity, the Trump Foundation, was shut down."
"Is­rael ad­vances wa­ter-for-en­er­gy deal with Jor­dan, UAE",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/26/israel-advances-water-for-energy-deal-with-jordan-uae,A tri­par­tite agree­ment is ex­pect­ed to be signed at the COP28 con­fer­ence in Dubai in No­vem­ber.,"Israel’s energy minister and the chief executive of UAE’s renewable energy firm Masdar have met to advance a water-for-energy deal with Jordan, according to the Israeli energy ministry. The aim of the meeting on Tuesday was to advance the projects before an expected signing at the annual UN climate conferenceCOP28to be held in Dubai in November, the ministry said in a statement. The statement did not specify where the meeting was held, but said it came on the heels of the “successful ministerial meeting” that took place in Abu Dhabi last month in the presence of Israel’s energy minister, as well as a visit by Masdar’s representatives to Israel earlier this month. Under the proposed agreement, Jordan will supply solar energy from a UAE-funded plant to Israel and receive desalinated water from Israel in return. The Times of Israel reported that political and commercial agreements will have to be signed after the agreement is sealed. In June, Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz discussed the projects with the US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate Affairs John Kerry. He presented a plan to build a 600MW capacity solar plant with storage in Jordan, and for Israel to export 200 million cubic metres of desalinated water per year to its neighbour, the energy ministry said at the time. The projects are known respectively as Prosperity Green and Prosperity Blue. The agreement aims to address Jordan’s need for water and Israel’s aim to grow its clean energy mix. Jordan is the country’s second-most water-scarce country in the world, according to UNICEF. The UAE became only the third Arab nation, after Egypt (1979) and Jordan (1994), to establishdiplomatic relations with Israel, ending a 25-year period without such ties."
Nige­ria’s labour unions call in­def­i­nite strike over cost of liv­ing,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/26/nigerias-labour-unions-call-indefinite-strike-over-cost-of-living,Unions have an­nounced a strike be­gin­ning on Oc­to­ber 3 af­ter Pres­i­dent Bola Tin­ubu scrapped a sub­sidy on fuel.,"Nigeria’s two biggest workers’ unions plan to start an indefinite strike next week to protest against acost of living crisisafter the government scrapped a popular but costly petrol subsidy, union leaders have said. The National Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC), the biggest unions, said on Tuesday they would begin the strike on October 3. “It’s going to be a total shutdown … until government meets the demand of Nigerian workers, and in fact Nigerian masses,” the union leaders said in a joint statement. “The Federal Government has refused to meaningfully engage and reach agreements with organised labour on critical issues of the consequences of the unfortunate hike in price of petrol which has unleashed massive suffering on Nigeria workers and masses.” Unions have been pushing President Bola Tinubu to reverse his decision in May toscrap the decades-old subsidythat had kept fuel prices low but was draining government finances. The government had urged unions to continue negotiations instead of resorting to strikes, saying this would hurt an economy grappling with double-digit inflation, foreign currency shortages and low oil production. Prices have risen sharply, including the cost of food, transport and power as most businesses and households rely on petrol generators for electricity. Tinubu has defended his two biggest reforms – removal of the subsidy and foreign exchange controls – saying although this would lead to hardships in the short term, they were necessary to attract investment and boost government finances. Africa’s largest economy has seen living and transport costs heavily impacted after the government ended a petrol subsidy and also freed the naira currency, leading to a sharp devaluation of the local money. Inflation is at 25 percent while fuel costs have tripled since Tinubu came to power in May. Tinubu’s administration acknowledges the difficulties and says it distributed funds to state governments to help offset the impact of the economic reforms. Other measures include providing transport options and small business loans. The NLC brings together unions for many industries from nurses to road workers and printers while the TUC represents senior bank workers and high school teachers among others. It was not clear how much traction next week’s industrial action would gain. The NLC and TUCcalled a strike in Augustover the same issues, with many businesses, government offices, markets and banks closed for a day in the capital Abuja. Strike impact in the economic capital Lagos was more mixed. Nigeria, a member of the OPEC oil exporters’ organisation, is a major crude producer but lacks refining capacity and is forced to import most of its fuel requirements."
