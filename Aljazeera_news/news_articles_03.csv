A defiant Trump attacked New York’s attorney general and the judge overseeing his civil fraud trial as it began on Monday, with a state lawyer accusing him of generating more than $100m by lying about his real estate empire. Attorney General Letitia James is seeking at least $250m in fines, a permanent ban against Trump and his sons Donald Jr and Eric from running businesses in New York and a five-year commercial real estate ban against Trump and the Trump Organization. What were the standout moments from the first day of the trial? And what do they mean for Trump? We take a look at some key takeaways below: "
What has NASA’s James Webb Space Tele­scope found?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/2/james-webb-telescope-finding-jupiter-sized-objects-in-orion-nebula-baffles-scientists,"The new en­ti­ties, nick­named ‘JuM­BOs’, are nei­ther stars nor plan­ets. And they shouldn’t ex­ist, re­searchers say.","Scientists at the European Space Agency (ESA) have used NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to make an astonishing discovery: free-floating objects the size of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, in the Orion Nebula, the nearest star-forming region to Earth. The discovery has upended our understanding of how stars and planets are formed. Before this, scientists thought nebulas, which give birth to stars inside huge clouds of gas and dust, weren’t capable of spontaneously creating planet-sized objects, but the new findings suggest otherwise. Even more baffling is the fact that the objects are formed in pairs instead of individually. “There’s something wrong with either our understanding of planet formation, star formation – or both,” Samuel Pearson, an ESA scientist who worked on the research, told The New York Times. “They shouldn’t exist.”  The new entities have been called Jupiter Mass Binary Objects, or JuMBOs. They aren’t big enough to be stars, and because they don’t orbit around a star, JuMBOs aren’t technically planets. “Most of us don’t have time to get wrapped up in this debate about what is a planet and what isn’t a planet,” Professor Mark McCaughrean, a senior adviser for science and exploration at the ESA, told The Guardian. “It’s like my car is a chihuahua-mass pet. But it’s not a chihuahua. It’s a cat.” According to a research paper that McCaughrean co-authored and hasn’t been peer-reviewed yet, JuMBOs are about a million years old, which makes them young relative to the rest of the universe. Their surface temperatures are roughly 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,800 degrees Fahrenheit). But unlike planets, which are eventually able to maintain consistent temperatures thanks to the energy they receive from the stars they orbit, JuMBOs eventually cool down rapidly and freeze. They’re also largely made up of gas, which means they’re unlikely to be able to support life.  Scientists have multiple hypotheses for how JuMBOs came into being. The first is that they were formed in areas of the nebula too sparse to create proper stars. The second is that they were formed as planets meant to orbit stars but then got “kicked out” for unknown reasons. “The ejection hypothesis is the favored one at the moment,” McCaughrean told the BBC. “We know single planets can get kicked out from star systems. But how do you kick out pairs of these things together? Right now, we don’t have an answer. It’s one for the theoreticians.” Other scientists called the pairs phenomenon unprecedented. “My reactions ranged from ‘Whaaat?!?’ to ‘Are you sure?’ to ‘That’s just so weird’ to ‘How could binaries be ejected together?’” astronomer Heidi Hammel, who was not on the research team, told the BBC. No current scientific models, she said, predicted pairs of planet-sized objects being ejected from a nebula but added that maybe there just hasn’t been a telescope powerful enough to spot them before. Scientists and astronomers have studied the Orion Nebula for years to observe the formation and early evolution of stars and other celestial objects. It lies 1,350 light years away from Earth and is visible to the naked eye as a misty smudge at the bottom of the Orion constellation, part of the “sword” of a mythical Greek hunter whom the constellation is named after."
Sau­di-Iran Asian Cham­pi­ons League game can­celled in row over Soleimani bust,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/2/saudi-iran-asian-champions-league-game-cancelled-in-row-over-soleimani-bust,Sau­di club re­fus­es to leave lock­er room for game against Iran’s Sep­a­han over stat­ue of slain Iran­ian gen­er­al in sta­di­um.,"A football match between Saudi and Iranian teams in the Asian Champions League has been called off due to the presence of a statue of former Iranian Major GeneralQassem Soleimaniat the entrance of the field. A clash scheduled for Monday between Saudi’sAl Ittihadand Iran’s Sepahan was postponed after the Saudi team refused to leave the dressing room at the Naghsh-e Jahan Stadium in the Iranian city of Isfahan. “The AFC reiterates its commitment towards ensuring the safety and security of the players, match officials, spectators, and all stakeholders involved,” the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) said in a statement. “This matter will now be referred to the relevant committees.”  Soleimani – who commanded the foreign operations arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, its specialisedQuds Force– played a central role in directing Iran’s activities across the Middle East for several decades before being assassinated by aUS air strikein January 2020. Sometimes known as the “shadow commander”, he guided Iranian efforts to influence events across the region, overseeing activities in countries such as Lebanon, Iraq and Syria. He is viewed as a hero by the Iranian government, but seen as a key architect of Iranian policy by the Saudis. Photographs on social media showed a bust ofSoleimaniplaced at the entrance of the football pitch, prominently displayed before players who would have exited the tunnel onto the field.  While Iran and Saudi Arabia have made efforts toease tensionsin recent months, relations remain highly strained. The dispute comes one month after Saudi Arabia and Iran announced a “groundbreaking” deal to resume home-and-away football matches between club sides after seven years of competing in neutral venues. That agreement was the latest sign of rapprochement stemming from a surprise China-brokered deal announced in March that saw the longtime rivals agree to restore diplomatic relations and reopen their respective embassies following a seven-year rupture. Cristiano Ronaldo’s Saudi club Al Nassr played a match in Tehran on September 19, the first time a Saudi club had played in Iran since 2016. Previous matches between clubs from Iran and Saudi Arabia had been played in neutral territories due to concerns over security."
"Bangladesh dengue deaths cross 1,000 in worst out­break on record",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/2/bangladesh-dengue-deaths-cross-1000-in-worst-outbreak-on-record,"At least 1,017 die and near­ly 209,000 in­fect­ed, mak­ing 2023 the dead­liest year since first record­ed epi­dem­ic in 2000.","More than 1,000 people in Bangladesh have died of dengue fever this year, official data shows – nearly four times more than in the whole of last year. At least 1,017 people have died in the first nine months of 2023 and nearly 209,000 have become infected, making it the country’s worst recorded outbreak of themosquito-borne diseasesince the first tallied epidemic in 2000. Among the dead are 112 children aged 15 and under, including infants. Hospitals in Bangladesh are struggling to make space for patients as the disease spreads rapidly in the densely-populated South Asian country. Dengue is a disease endemic to tropical areas and causes high fevers, headaches, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain and, in the most serious cases, bleeding that can lead to death. The World Health Organization (WHO) haswarnedthat dengue and other diseases caused by mosquito-borne viruses, such as chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika, are spreading faster and further due to climate change. There is no vaccine or drug that specifically treats dengue, which is common in South Asia during the June-to-Septembermonsoon seasonas the Aedes aegypti mosquito that spreads the disease thrives in stagnant water. However, in recent years, hospitals in Bangladesh have also begun to admit patients suffering from the disease during winter months. Those with repeat infections are at greater risk of complications. Mohammad Rafiqul Islam, a doctor at Dhaka’s Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College and Hospital, said most patients admitted at his hospital were suffering their second or third cases of dengue. “When people have dengue for the second, third or fourth time, the severity is increased. The number of deaths are also higher,” he told AFP news agency. “Many are coming to us when it’s already late in their illness,” he said. “Then it’s really complicated to treat them.”  Bangladesh has recorded cases of dengue from the 1960s, but documented its first outbreak of dengue haemorrhagic fever, a severe and sometimes fatal symptom of the disease, in 2000. The virus that causes the disease is now endemic to Bangladesh, which has seen a trend of worsening outbreaks since the turn of the century. The surge in cases has prompted the government to step up its anti-dengue campaign, from raising awareness to efforts to kill mosquito larvae following a spell of rains, officials said. However, a lack of proper prevention measures has allowed the dengue-carrying mosquito to spread all over Bangladesh, said Kabirul Bashar, an entomologist and zoology professor at Jahangirnagar University. “From 2000 to 2018, dengue only happened in Dhaka city, but in 2019 it transferred to different cities. This year it transferred into the rural areas also.”"
What is FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s tri­al about?,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/10/2/what-is-ftx-founder-sam-bankman-frieds-trial-about,"Bankman-Fried, who had his bail re­voked in Au­gust, faces mul­ti­ple charges of mon­ey laun­der­ing and fraud.","The trial of disgraced crypto tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried is set to open on October 3 in New York after a whirlwind year. Since the collapse of his cryptocurrency exchange FTX and its partner hedge fund Alameda Research in November last year, ex-CEO Bankman-Fried was quickly investigated by federal prosecutors and the United States Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) before he was extradited from the Bahamas in early January. Bankman-Fried now faces multiple money laundering and fraud charges, but prosecutors also allege that he used his $32bn empire to influence the US political establishment, Hollywood and even Chinese officials. Initially allowed to live with his parents in California on a $250m bail, that privilege was revoked after he was accused of witness tampering in August, and he has been lodged in a Brooklyn jail since. As he heads into court tomorrow, Bankman-Fried, 31, faces seven counts of wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering or conspiracy to commit these crimes. Prosecutors will also present evidence that Bankman-Fried violated campaign finance laws as ​​he used stolen funds to pay for $100m in political donations. If found guilty, Bankman-Friedfaces over 100 years in federal prison, where inmates do not get massive sentence reductions for “good behaviour”. Following further investigation, Bankman-Fried is now facing a second trial in March 2024 on five additional charges. Among them is an allegation that Bankman-Fried violated the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by paying a $40m bribe to one or more Chinese officials to unfreeze Alameda Research accounts. FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2019 by Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang, the company’s chief technology officer, after raising $1.8bn from investors. While crypto fans can choose from several exchanges, FTX was promoted as a “safe, responsible crypto asset trading platform”, according to an SEC complaint, with Bankman-Fried “specifically touting FTX’s sophisticated, automated risk measures to protect customer assets” like a “proprietary ‘risk engine’”. Prosecutors, however, allege that FTX’s real purpose was to prop up Bankman-Fried’s other company, Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency hedge fund he founded in 2017. FTX allegedly supplied Alameda with a “virtually unlimited line of credit” secretly funded with billions of dollars diverted from FTX customers as well as FTX’s “overvalued” token, FTT. Following the charges in December, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said Bankman-Fried “built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto”. Both companies filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, wiping out billions in FTX customer assets.  Bankman-Fried and his associates may have carried on their activities for much longer if it weren’t for a few key moments in 2022. First came the global downturn in the crypto industry that began when the US Federal Reserve started raising interest rates at the start of 2022 to tame inflation. As a string of cryptocurrencies, including so-called low-risk “stablecoins” went bust, Alameda was forced to borrow more money from investors to stay afloat. While it is not unusual for companies to borrow additional funds from investors when times get tough, in this case, the company also diverted FTX customer funds without permission through a secret backdoor to create a $65bn credit line. But Bankman-Fried and his associates didn’t just use the money to avoid margin calls when investors would demand the company show they could pay their debts or risk a selloff. They were also paying for a massive spending spree throughout 2021 and 2022 that included $200m in luxury real estate in the Bahamas, $100m in US campaign contributions, and millions more on travel, food and hotels Then came the cryptocurrency trade publication CoinDesk, which managed to get its hands on one of Alameda Research’s balance sheets in late 2022. The CoinDesk reporter and editor duo later said they initially did not know what they had gotten their hands on, but their series of scoops revealing the “shaky foundations” of Alameda Research unleashed an avalanche of reporting and multiple investigations. Finally came Bankman-Fried rival, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of the massive Binance crypto exchange, who sold the company’s share in FTX within days of the CoinDesk reports. As other customers, too, tried to cash out, FTX ran out of funds to pay back investors. While it had appeared for a moment that Binance might bail out FTX, Binance changed its mind and both FTX and Alameda were forced to file for bankruptcy. In total, FTX reportedly lost nearly $9bn in customer assets, of which a reported $5bn has been recovered so far during its bankruptcy. The scandal has not only hit the cryptocurrency and venture capital world but also Washington, DC, where Bankman-Fried lobbied “members of Congress and other high-level government officials to promote cryptocurrency regulation that would favour his business and personal interests”, according to his indictment. The case has also embarrassed numerous celebrities like comedian Larry David, supermodel Gisele Bundchen, and A-list athletes like Naomi Osaka, Stephen Curry and Tom Brady, who all signed on to endorse FTX and are facing legal action for not disclosing their financial ties. They may also be required to return their payments. In addition to Bankman-Fried’s trial, which starts October 3, his closest deputies are also facing their own legal drama. They include FTX co-founder Gary Wang, top FTX executive Ryan Salame, FTX head of engineering Nishad Sing, and Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, who was also Bankman-Fried’s romantic partner. Unlike Bankman-Fried, the four pleaded guilty and negotiated deals with the prosecution that included restitution of payments and assets. In a recent turn of events, Bankman-Fried’s parents are also now under scrutiny. The two Stanford Law professors, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, are being sued by FTX, now under the leadership of CEO and bankruptcy specialist John J Ray, in a bid to recover millions of dollars in gifts and misappropriated funds channelled to them. Ray told a Delaware bankruptcy court last year that FTX was the worst case of corporate governance and oversight in a 40-year career that included a stint at Enron – once the watchword for corporate malfeasance – recovering investor assets. “Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,” Raysaid in a court filing. “From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented.”"
EU dis­miss­es doubts over long-term com­mit­ment to Ukraine in Kyiv meet­ing,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/2/eu-dismisses-doubts-over-long-term-commitment-to-ukraine-in-kyiv-meeting,"While West­ern as­sis­tance for Ukraine re­mains ro­bust, crit­ics of that sup­port have be­come in­creas­ing­ly vo­cal in EU, US.","The European Union has brushed aside questions over whether the bloc will remain committed toassisting Ukrainein the long term as schisms over the issue begin to form in the United States and Europe. A delegation of EU foreign ministers made anunannounced visitto the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Monday, offering an image of cohesion and reiterating their support for the country’s struggle against Russia’s invasion. “The EU remains united in its support to Ukraine. … I don’t see any member state folding on their engagement,” EU foreign policy chiefJosep Borrelltold reporters. Borrell described the gathering as “historic” but made clear there would be no new concrete announcements. “It is the first time that we met in a candidate country. And unfortunately, it was also the first time that the foreign ministers of the European Union met in a country at war,” he said at a press conference.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the ministers the duration of the war – now in its 20th month – was linked to the quality and quantity of support Ukraine receives from its allies. “Our victory directly depends on our cooperation: the more strong and principled steps we take together, the sooner this war will end,” Zelenskyy said in a statement. To bring about a speedy end to fighting, he urged the EU to expand sanctions on Russia and Iran, which has supplied attack drones for Russian forces. And he called for the “acceleration” of work to direct “frozen Russian assets to finance the restoration of war-torn Ukraine”.  The Kyiv meeting was convened amid growing signs that Westernsupport for assistanceto Ukraine is becoming more fractured. In the US, right-wing conservatives have become increasingly vocal in their attacks on US support, and a former Slovakian prime minister who promised “not a single round” of assistanceled his party to victoryin parliamentary elections over the weekend. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has also become more critical of Kyiv in recent months and said Hungary is in no rush to approve Sweden’s accession to NATO. Some countries in the Global South have also cooled on efforts bycountries like the USto rally support for Ukraine. They have been hammered economically by the war and are sceptical of being forced to choose between amicable relations with either the West or Russia.  As the war grinds on, supporters of Ukraine worry that governments and voters could lose interest in the conflict and move away from commitments to provide Kyiv with essential military and economic support. “Our victory directly depends on our cooperation: the more strong and principled steps we take together, the sooner this war will end,” Zelenskyy said in a statement after meeting the foreign ministers. In both the US and the EU, however,support for assistanceremains widespread and substantial. “The vast majority of both parties – Democrats and Republicans, Senate and House – support helping Ukraine and the brutal aggression that is being thrust upon them by Russia,” US PresidentJoe Bidensaid on Sunday as assistance to Ukraine figured in negotiations to avoid a government shutdown. The US avoided a shutdown by passing a short-term spending package that did not include support for Ukraine."
Could US House Speak­er Kevin Mc­Carthy lose his job?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/2/could-us-house-speaker-kevin-mccarthy-lose-his-job,Hard­line Re­pub­li­cans are threat­en­ing to oust their own par­ty’s speak­er — us­ing a rule Mc­Carthy him­self in­tro­duced.,"It was a moment of victory for United States House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy that has also left the veteran Republican’s job at risk. On Saturday, the House approved aMcCarthy-brokered funding billthat will keep the US government running until November 17 after weeks of negotiations between Democrats, who are in power, and Republicans, who have demanded spending cuts. The bill was also passed by the Senate and signed into law by President Joe Biden. But it has left a vocal section ofRepublicans angry with McCarthy— and baying for political blood. McCarthy had tried earlier to push through a bill that addressed Republican demands, including 30 percent budget cuts for many agencies, but that fell through after most Democrats opposed it. With predictions of a government shutdown widespread, McCarthy then manage to stitch together a deal with support from Democrats. His proposal was eventually backed 335-91 in the House with 209 Democrats and 126 Republicans voting for it. Ninety Republicans opposed the move, arguing that the compromise bill gave up on key demands for budget cuts. In a Sunday post on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, McCarthy said: “I just signed and sent this short-term stop-gap bill to the White House in order to fund our troops, deliver emergency relief, and keep government open while Congress gets back to work through regular order.” But a small group of hardline Republicans who were calling for spending cuts from federal agencies and changes to border security is upset over McCarthy’s collaboration with Democrats to get the bill passed. Matt Gaetz, a Republican congressman from Florida, is leading calls for McCarthy’s ouster after the speaker’s critics within his own party said they would take action if he worked with the Democrats on the funding bill. Ironically, McCarthy himself has set the stage for a challenge to his position. The Republican politician became the 55th speaker of the House, after 15 rounds of voting in January. To get voted in, he made several concessions: one of them was allowing just one member from the House to put forward a motion for the speaker to vacate his post. So now, it would take only one member of the House — say Gaetz — to introduce a resolution to call for the speaker to vacate his position. Once considered, it needs a simple majority to pass. The motion could compromise McCarthy’s stature as a Republican leader because he might need to draw on significant support from Democrats in the House to survive such a vote. McCarthy, who was first elected to the House as a representative for California’s 22nd District in 2006, is a veteran of political tumult. He had also tried to stand for speaker in 2015 but dropped out of the race after controversial comments he made about a government panel set up to investigate the2012 Benghazi attackin Libya. Although McCarthy hasn’t publicly endorsed Donald Trump in next year’s presidential elections, he is known to be his staunch supporter. If he is removed as speaker, it is unclear who might replace him in the politically influential position. Without a speaker, bills cannot be approved and legislation would not be passed, leaving the House of Representatives redundant. But history is on McCarthy’s side: No speaker has ever been removed through a motion to vacate. Yet."

Slovakia’s Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs said on Monday that it summoned a Russian embassy representative who spoke about “interference” by the United States in the country, an accusation the ministry called false. It said the comments were made on the eve of the Slovak parliamentary elections on Saturday when a moratorium on information that may benefit or harm candidates was in place. “The department of diplomacy strongly protests against the false statement of Russian intelligence which cast doubt on the integrity of the free and democratic election in Slovakia,” the ministry said. “We consider such deliberately spread of disinformation to be unacceptable interference by the Russian Federation in the election process.” It called on Russia to cease all disinformation activities aimed at Slovakia. The Russian embassy in Slovakia rejected the allegations. “Unlike some of Slovakia’s current allies, we do not interfere with internal affairs of other countries, we do not take part in regime changes and various ‘colour’ revolutions,” it said on Facebook.  Slovakia’s president on Monday asked the leader of the winning party to try to form a coalition government. Populist former Prime Minister Robert Fico and his leftist Smer, or Direction, party captured 22.9 percent of the vote on Saturday. It will have 42 seats in the 150-seat parliament. If he succeeds in forming a coalition government, Fico, 59, will become prime minister for the fourth time. Fico campaigned on apro-Russian and anti-American message, has pledged to end Slovakmilitary support for Ukraineand opposes sanctions on Russia. In a televised address to the nation on Monday, President Zuzana Caputova stressed that the new government would have to be “a government which will serve all citizens”. Fico has repeatedly attacked the liberal president, accusing her of being an American agent and serving foreign interests. Caputova has sued him for the remarks."

The 68-year-old Mukwege made the announcement before a crowd of supporters in the DRC capital of Kinshasa on Monday, challenging current PresidentFelix Tshisekediin the upcoming December elections. “I agree to be your candidate for president of the republic,” he stated, adding that he would focus on issues such as insecurity and political leadership. Mukwege, a surgical gynaecologist who jointly won the Nobel Prize in 2018 with Yazidi activist Nadia Murad for their efforts tocombat the useof sexual violence as a weapon of war, now hopes to confront problems facing the DRC.  The doctor founded Panzi Hospital in eastern DRC during a period of brutal conflict in 1999, treating hundreds of victims of rape and bearing witness to the injuries and diseases inflicted on them. Today, the Central African nation faces deteriorating security, withnumerous militia groups, including oneknown as M23, fighting for control of territory in the country’s eastern regions. President Tshisekedi has struggled to contain the violence during his first term in office, andhastened the withdrawalof a United Nations peacekeeping force in September amid complaints about its ineffectiveness and lack of popularity. A month earlier, the country’s military came under heavy criticism for usinglethal forceagainst a planned protest against the UN force, in a harsh crackdown that killed 56 people. In apress releaselast month, Mukwege said he was “deeply outraged by the shocking images of the massacre” and called for “far-reaching reform” to professionalise the country’s security services. Debate over issues such as security and economic hardship have become more acute as the country approaches parliamentary and presidential elections, scheduled to take place on December 20. Opposition leader Martin Fayulu, who came in second behind Tshisekedi in the 2018 elections, also announced over the weekend that he will mount a bid for the presidency. "
"WHO rec­om­mends sec­ond malar­ia vac­cine for chil­dren, roll­out ear­ly next year",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/2/who-recommends-second-malaria-vaccine-for-children-rollout-early-next-year,"R21/Ma­trix-M vac­cine, made by Serum In­sti­tute of In­dia, is ap­proved al­ready for use in Burk­i­na Faso, Ghana and Nige­ria.","The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended a second malaria vaccine, a decision that could offer countries a cheaper and a more readily available option than the world’s first shot against the parasitic disease. The R21/Matrix-M, developed by Britain’s Oxford University, can be used to curb the life-threatening disease spread to humans by some mosquitoes, the WHO said on Monday. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the UN health agency was approving the newmalaria vaccinebased on the advice of two expert groups, recommending its use in children at risk of the disease. “As a malaria researcher, I used to dream of the day we would have a safe and effective vaccine against malaria. Now we have two,” Tedros said. The R21/Matrix-M vaccine is manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and has already been approved for use in Burkina Faso, Ghana and Nigeria. The vaccine will be rolled out in those African countries in early 2024 and will be available in mid-2024 in other countries, Tedros said, adding that doses would cost from $2 to $4. “WHO is now reviewing the vaccine for prequalification, which is WHO stamp of approval, and will enable GAVI [a global vaccine alliance] and UNICEF to buy the vaccine from manufacturers,” Tedros said. Oxford University developed the new three-dose vaccine with help from the Serum Institute of India. Research has suggested it is more than 75 percent effective and protection is maintained for at least another year with a booster. Neither of the malaria vaccines available, however, stop transmission, so immunisation campaigns alone won’t be enough to stop epidemics. Efforts to curb the disease are also being complicated by increasing reports of resistance to the main drugs used to treat malaria and the spread of invasive mosquito species.  Tedros said the WHO had also recommended Takeda Pharmaceuticals’ vaccine againstdenguefor children aged six to 16 living in areas where the infection is a significant public health problem. Dengue, common in tropical and subtropical climates, is a viral infection spread from mosquitoes to people. Takeda’s vaccine, called Qdenga, was shown in trials to be effective against all four serotypes of the virus in people who were previously infected with dengue, Hanna Nohynek, chairwoman of the WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, told journalists. She added, however, that there remained uncertainty about its performance against serotypes 3 and 4 in people who have not been infected previously. Nearly 1,000 people have died of dengue this year in anongoing epidemic in Bangladesh, the country’s worst outbreak of the disease. The WHO’s strategic advisory group also recommended a simplified single dose regime for primary immunisation for mostCOVID-19 vaccinesto improve acceptance of the shots at a time when most people have had at least one prior infection "
What is the No­bel Prize and what to ex­pect this year?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/2/what-is-the-nobel-prize-and-what-to-expect-this-year,There are 351 nom­i­nees for the No­bel Peace Prize this year.,"The Nobel Prizes are slated to be announced this week with the first award in medicine or physiology won by Hungary’sKatalin Kariko and Drew Weissmanof the United States on Monday. Their research led to the first mRNA vaccines to fight COVID-19, made by Pfizer and Moderna, according to the awarding body. Here is what we know about the Nobel Prizes: The Nobel Prizes were created by Alfred Nobel, a wealthy 19th-century businessman, inventor and chemist from Sweden. In his will, Nobel dictated that his estate should be used to fund “prizes to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind”. The first Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901, five years after his death. Nobel named the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to award the prizes for chemistry and physics, the Swedish Academy for literature, Sweden’s Karolinska Institute medical university for physiology or medicine and the Norwegian parliament for peace. In 1968, Sweden’s central bank introduced the Prize in Economic Sciences with a donation to the Nobel Foundation. The prize is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, according to the same principles as the other prizes. It is now presented with the other prizes despite Nobel purists’ assertion that the economics prize is not a Nobel Prize. Six Nobel Prizes are awarded each year, recognising an individual’s or group’s contribution to a specific field. All of the announcements will be livestreamed atnobelprize.org. There are 351 nominees for the Nobel Peace Prize this year. This is the second highest number of nominees since 2016, when 376 candidates were nominated. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian dissident Alexey Navalny are among bookmakers’ favorites for this year’s peace prize. However, peace researchers predicted that the honour could go to activists working towards women’s rights and the environment. Historically, the vast majority of Nobel Prize winners have been white men. With Monday’s announcement, 61 women have won Nobel Prizes out of the 956 individuals who have been honoured, including 26 in the scientific categories. Nobel Prize winners receive a Nobel Prize diploma, a gold medal and a cheque. The amount on the cheque this year is about $1m. Each diploma is a uniquework of art, created by Swedish and Norwegian artists and calligraphers. The laureates collect these prizes in an official ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death. The peace prize is handed out by the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel committee in Oslo while the other prizes are presented by the Swedish king in Stockholm’s Concert Hall. Notable Nobel laureates include scientists like Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr and Marie Curie, authors like Ernest Hemingway and Albert Camus, and inspirational leaders like Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr and Mother Teresa. While most achievements are still celebrated, some awards have not aged well, such as Egas Moniz’s 1949 prize in physiology or medicine for the since banned and discredited practice of lobotomy. Two winners have refused their Nobel Prizes in the past: French writer Jean-Paul Sartre, who turned down the literature prize in 1964, and Vietnamese politician Le Duc Tho, who declined the peace prize that he was meant to share with US diplomat Henry Kissinger in 1973."
‘Mu­sic to Bei­jing’s ears’: Has Chi­na won the Mal­dives pres­i­den­cy?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/2/music-to-beijings-ears-has-china-won-the-maldives-presidency,"Mo­hamed Muiz­zu’s elec­tion win is a set­back for In­dia, a boost for Chi­na and a sign of ten­sions in In­di­an Ocean re­gion.","The Maldives has a population of half a million people scattered across more than 1,000 islands. But last weekend, the picturesque archipelago delivered an electoral verdict that has sent shock waves around the world — and especially across the Indian Ocean region. Mohamed Muizzu, the opposition candidate, emerged victorious in the presidential run-off on Saturday andsecured54 percent of the vote, results released by the electoral commission showed. Muizzu, who backs closer ties between the Maldives and China, defeated the incumbent President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, who is widely perceived as pro-India. “With today’s result, we have got the opportunity to build the country’s future,” Muizzu said in a statement after his victory. “The strength to ensure the freedom of Maldives.” The vote transformed into a de facto referendum over the country’s ties with India and China. India has 75 military personnel stationed in the Maldives. New Delhi says they are there to maintain and operate two helicopters and an aircraft it donated to the country. Throughout his election campaign, Muizzu pledged to remove those troops from the Maldives. “Seen from the zero-sum lens that often drives great power competition, Beijing is a big winner from this election,” Michael Kugelman, South Asia director at the Wilson Center, a Washington-based think-tank, told Al Jazeera. “Muizzu’s campaign plank was not only about strengthening ties with Beijing, it was also about aiming to undermine India by calling for an end to any Indian military presence in Maldives. This is music to the ears of Beijing,” he added. To be sure, India will look to retain as much of its influence in the Maldives as it can, say analysts. Following the announcement of Muizzu’s victory, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent his congratulations to the president-elect. “India remains committed to strengthening the time-tested India-Maldives bilateral relationship and enhancing our overall cooperation in the Indian Ocean Region,” Modi said on X, formerly known as Twitter.  New Delhi has enjoyed cosy ties with Male under President Solih, who took office following a landslide victory in 2018 against Muizzu’s mentor, former President Abdulla Yameen. India poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the tourist hot spot. New Delhi also financed infrastructure projects, both big and small, in the country. “India will support the new democratically elected government and will seek to work closely with it,” Shantanu Roy-Chaudhury, author of The China Factor: Beijing’s Expanding Engagement in Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, told Al Jazeera. The Modi government, he said, is “likely to continue its pursuit of the Greater Male Connectivity Projects” — a 6.7km (4-mile) road project currently under construction that aims to link the capital, Male, with the island of Villingili. India has given the Maldives a $100m grant and a $400m line of credit for the infrastructure initiative. But the road ahead won’t be easy for New Delhi, said Roy-Chaudhury. “Given the new government’s pro-China outlook, the future of Indian influence and development projects hangs in the balance,” he said. Muizzu, a 45-year-old civil engineer by training, has taken aim at the imbalanced trade relationship between the Maldives and India, promising to fix it. But while trade between the South Asian neighbours is heavily skewed towards India — as is often the case between a giant economy and a smaller one — the Maldives fares little better when it comes to China. India’s exports to the Maldives amounted to$416m in 2021, while it imported $49m from the smaller nation. China, meanwhile, exported goods worth$395mto the Maldives, and its imports were valued at $3.9m. Muizzu emerged as an unexpected candidate to lead the Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM), after serving as the construction minister in the administration of Yameen. A path to the country’s top seat opened up for him after Yameen, also a pro-China leader, was put behind bars on corruption charges. Under Yameen, the Maldives obtained more than $1bn in loans from China to finance huge infrastructure projects, including housing for residents of land-scarce Male and a first-of-its-kind bridge connecting the congested capital to nearby suburb and airport islands.  Analysts say the change of guard in Male could present an opportunity for not just Beijing but also Chinese investors. “Beijing will certainly try to move in, though I wouldn’t overstate the impact of the election on its investment patterns,” Kugelman said. “Even in the era of Solih, who was pro-India but not hostile to China, we saw some continued Chinese commercial collaborations with the Maldives – not on the level we saw during the Yameen era, but still substantive activity. Certainly, though, Muizzi’s victory will be empowering, for Chinese investors as well as Chinese grand strategists and diplomats.” Kugelman said the election results might be a “body blow” to India, both diplomatically and geopolitically, but New Delhi will not throw in the towel. “By no means is New Delhi planning to raise the red flag and effectively cede the Maldives to China. That would fly in the face of its intense competition with Beijing,” he said. “New Delhi will remain confident it can continue to have some degree of partnership with Male.” As Muizzu prepares to take office on November 17, Roy-Chaudhury said the new leader of the Maldives might not be able to abandon New Delhi completely and pivot towards Beijing even if he wanted to. India, he said, would continue to emphasise its developmental aid and seek to build on it. “India and the Maldives both need each other.”"

"Pussy Riot’s Tolokon­niko­va: ‘Rus­sia wants me poi­soned, dead, or in jail’",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/2/pussy-riots-tolokonnikova-russia-wants-me-poisoned-dead-or-in-jail,"A found­ing mem­ber of the punk fem­i­nist art col­lec­tive, who is want­ed in Rus­sia, talks to Al Jazeera.","Nadya Tolokonnikova, an artist and activist, was placed on Russia’s most wanted list in March. Weeks earlier, she had released an irreverent short film entitled Putin’s Ashes, in which a group of women from Ukraine, Russia and Belarus, dressed in lingerie and wearing red balaclavas, press the nuclear button and set alight a 10-foot portrait of the Russian president. “Join our movement against the most dangerous living dictator on the planet,” reads the caption accompanying the three-minute clip. A co-founder of Pussy Riot, the Russian feminist protest art collective formed in 2011, she was reportedly accused by Moscow of “insulting the religious feelings of believers”. She has recently spent much of her time focused on the conflict in Ukraine, raising nearly $7m for Ukrainian war efforts through her cryptocurrency UkraineDAO. She has also curated My Body, My Business at Sotheby’s in support of abortion rights in the United States. Al Jazeera spoke with Tolokonnikova, who currently lives outside of Russia, about her art, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and her views on Moscow’s crackdown on dissent. Al Jazeera: You’ve spent several years in the kind of penal colonies dissidents will now be detained in. What is life like there, in terms of conditions and treatment, and do you think these sites have changed in nature since the war began? Nadya Tolokonnikova:A lot of things have changed since I was in jail, and I was hoping they would change for the better. I’d noticed a few main things to tackle in the Russian prison system: First, we need to get rid of forced labour. We still have this gulag Soviet inheritance of forced labour. Second is the lack of medical treatment – many prisoners die from treatable conditions. And lastly, living conditions. A lot of those facilities have not been updated since the gulag times. A lot of people still live in barracks, in very depressing conditions, often with no access to running water. We would go for weeks sometimes without being able to wash ourselves or our clothes. When I got out of jail, I was hoping that I’d be able to change it. And I did talk to some people who were leaving government offices at the time because it was still 2014, so some people from the opposition were still in government. We were hoping they were going to be able to bring prison reform in Russia. But instead, Russia went back to the new dark ages, starting with the war. It’s the same thing with feminist rights and LGBTQ+ people’s rights. Today, we cannot have any constructive conversations about the rights of prisoners, many of whom are being sent to the warzone to fight for the Russian side. They’re being used as canon meat for the war. Al Jazeera: How do you characterise the state of women’s rights in Russia, and how has the war in Ukraine impacted the struggle for gender equality? Tolokonnikova:With the beginning of the war in Ukraine, it became practically impossible to run a truly independent non-profit. And since our government does not really care about women’s rights, everything [is impacted] – from helping victims of domestic violence, to providing shelters for women, to fighting for our rights in the courts. In Russia, our self-defence law doesn’t work; if a woman killed someone who was threatening her or beating her up, she is sentenced for murder. And the only person who can help her is a human rights lawyer who could argue self-defence. But the government, or judge, or prosecutor, or cops – they don’t let you do that. So really the only people who can help women in Russia are women themselves and the non-profit sector. But the non-profits in this space that were actually legitimate and useful and independent – not just government puppets – were labelled as foreign agents [after the war erupted]. And most of the founders and members of those had to leave Russia because in the last couple of years, even projects that are not directly connected to politics – like helping women or protecting victims of domestic violence. Anna Rivina, the founder of nasiliu.net (No to Violence), Russia’s most prominent anti-domestic violence organisation, [who anticipated the increase in gender-based violence with the onset of the war in Ukraine] was labelled a foreign agent and had to leave Russia. There are numerous cases like this. When you have an extraordinary situation like this, when your country wages war, the conversations around human rights are set back hundreds of years. Nobody talks about feminism anymore or LGBTQ+ rights. There’s no one left in Russia who can talk about it. People are trying to help from the outside. Al Jazeera: What do you think awaits you if you were to return to Russia? Tolokonnikova:I currently have a criminal case opened on me for one of the works I did earlier this year for Putin’s Ashes, a performance that we showed for the first time at Jeffrey Deitch Gallery in LA. They used the Pussy Riot article, which they quite literally created while we were under investigation. They created this article in 2012 about hurting religious feelings. And it’s unclear how I was hurting religious feelings with my art, to me at least. [Editor’s note: Pussy Riot members including Tolokonnikova were charged in 2012 with “hooliganism motivated by religious hatred” after performing called Punk Prayer in Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, a song which attacked Putin and the Orthodox establishment.] If I go to Russia I’ll be immediately arrested. It was funny at first, and then I realised this comes with a price. The Russian passport is the only one I have, and it basically pretty much makes me a stateless person with few rights in the world. The only country that is supposed to protect my interests and defend my rights is the one which wants me poisoned, dead, or in jail. It does not feel good to be unprotected and stateless and having lots of troubles with travelling. Travel is very important for our job as activists and artists, and that creates complications. Al Jazeera: As an artist – and I know your politics and your art are inextricable – can you talk about how your aesthetic has developed? How have you found your artistic voice? Tolokonnikova:Contrasts are always very important for me. When we were coming up with the name Pussy Riot, we combined something traditionally seen as welcoming, cozy, nice, cute, sometimes even weak – that’s how people see it for some reason – with riot, which is the opposite of it. Contrasts are part of the Pussy Riot look, too. We have bold masks on our faces – they are purple, pink or neon. Yet at the same time, they’re not threatening, they’re still colourful so we signify we came with peace, not war or violence. And we wore very feminine dresses, which is not our everyday attire. When you’re running away from cops, it’s much easier to do it in pants rather than a bright colourful dress, but we decided to use it on purpose to show that femininity can be strong and bold, and riotous and rebellious, contrary to what a lot of people still believe. Al Jazeera: I see that contrast in your recent Putin’s Ashes work – the soft, plush frames combined with splattered blood, or traces of violence… Tolokonnikova:If you see Putin’s Ashes, it features women in practically lingerie. It’s important for me to state the fact that a woman can look how she wants to look. But it doesn’t take away anything from what she has to say. I think across the world really, conservatives are trying to push women into wearing something specific to be taken seriously. Al Jazeera: Can artistic production help people suffering within authoritarian regimes? Tolokonnikova:I think it can help on the emotional level. In my work, I try to combine my art with direct activism that influences people’s wellbeing, like helping prisoners or raising money for Ukraine, and making sure that I help someone in a very constructive and pragmatic manner. Art has a much more subtle influence on things, but it doesn’t mean that it’s less needed. A lot of us are talking specifically about Russian people and Russians who do not support Putin. A lot of us have this open wound after the war started. And we don’t really know how to talk about it, because obviously, our suffering cannot be compared to the suffering of Ukrainians. We still feel that wound and we cannot talk about it because it’s almost unethical. [Through my art, I’m trying to give a voice to], or at least acknowledge, the feelings of those people in Russia who feel unrepresented and silenced. If they decide to stay in Russia they cannot talk anymore, otherwise they’ll just end up in jail for dozens of years or be killed. Or maybe they’re outside of Russia, but they find they have a hard time talking about their feelings because, you know, who wants to hear about our feelings right now? Al Jazeera: How would you characterise Pussy Riot’s place within the history of political art of the past century? Tolokonnikova:Growing up, I really loved the Russian avant-garde movement – though that’s a very imperial phrase since many of its members were actually from Belarus or Ukraine. We have to come up with so many new terms. Russia has such a long way to go in decolonising itself, its history, its language. It’s pretty insane, and we’re just at the beginning of it. Anyway, I was really into [artists] like [Kazimir] Malevich, [Vladimir] Tatlin, [Vladimir] Mayakovsky. All of whom were men – they had women among them who were not that known at the time, unless they were lovers or wives. But then later feminist histories revealed that there were a lot of women in that movement. I always loved the avant-garde’s utopian vision for the world. Our godmothers are Valie Export, Judy Chicago, Marina Abramovic and Cindy Sherman. Guerrilla Girls, Riot grrrl, Jenny Holzer, Martha Rosler, Tracey Emin. We stand on the shoulders of these giants. Al Jazeera: And what do you think is next for you? Tolokonnikova:Well, I guess I’m hoping to not get poisoned or killed. Yeah. Note: This interview was lightly edited for clarity and brevity."
Cli­mate lead­ers gath­er in Spain be­fore ‘chal­leng­ing’ COP28,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/2/climate-leaders-gather-in-spain-ahead-of-challenging-cop28,En­er­gy min­is­ters and cli­mate lead­ers from around the world gath­er in Madrid be­fore the next month’s cli­mate sum­mit.,"Spain’s Energy Minister Teresa Ribera has warned that talks at the COP28 climate summit will be “challenging” as she opened a gathering of energy ministers and climate leaders from around the world in Madrid. Spain, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Council, is pushing for an international coalition to back the 2015 Paris deal’s target to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. At the COP28 conference, countries will assess how efforts to tackle climate change are falling short of the Paris Agreement goal and discuss plans to get on track. There are five conditions for the upcoming summit to be considered successful, the International Energy Agency chief, Fatih Birol, said. These include tripling global capital expenditure on renewables, doubling of energy efficiency improvements and an agreement on mechanisms to support clean energy financing in emerging countries. Global coal, oil and natural gas consumption may peak before 2030, he added. More than 20 oil and gas companies had positively answered calls to align around net zero by 2050, to eliminate methane emissions and stop routine flaring by 2030, COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber said at the conference. He did not elaborate. The COP28 summit is scheduled to take place in Dubai from November 30 to December 12. The summit is seen as a crucial opportunity for governments to expedite action to limit global warming with reports so far showing countries are off track to meet promises to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C."
EU for­eign min­is­ters in Ukraine’s Kyiv for un­prece­dent­ed meet­ing abroad,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/2/eu-foreign-ministers-in-ukraines-kyiv-for-unprecedented-meeting-abroad,Top diplo­mats of the bloc gath­er in Kyiv in the first-ever meet­ing out­side the EU bor­ders in show of sol­i­dar­i­ty.,"The foreign ministers of all 27 European Union member states are meeting in war-torn Ukraine in their first-ever meeting outside the bloc’s borders, displaying support for Kyiv. The unannounced meeting takes place as the Ukrainian government pushes to join the EU in the future, amidRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which is in its 20th month. “I am convening today the EU Foreign Ministers in Kyiv, for the first-ever meeting of all 27 Member States outside the EU,” the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a post on social media platform X on Monday. “Ukraine’s future lies within the EU,” he added. Top officials from EU capitals have often visited Kyiv since the beginning of the war, but this is the first time an official EU summit is being held in the Ukrainian capital. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba hailed the ministers’ meeting “within future borders” of the EU in a post on social media platform X. “Glad to welcome EU foreign ministers at the historic meeting in Ukraine,” he said, adding: “For the first time in history, outside current EU borders. But also within its future borders.”  French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said the meeting was a signal to Moscow of the bloc’s determination to support Ukraine over the long term. “It is a demonstration of our resolute and lasting support for Ukraine, until it can win. It is also a message to Russia that it should not count on our weariness. We will be there for a long time to come,” she told reporters in Kyiv. The EU member states, along with the United Kingdom and the United States, have provided massive military and financial support to Ukraine, enabling it to stand up to theRussian offensive. Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi, reporting from the Ukrainian city of Lubny, said the meeting symbolises a crucial moment in EU-Ukraine relations. “The Russian war in Ukraine is an existential threat not just to Ukraine, but to the European project,” he said. “The majority of EU countries speak in one voice when it comes to supporting Ukraine in this war,” Basravi said. Monday’s meeting comes days after the US Congressblockednew aid for Ukraine in a government spending deal despite calls from the White House in the opposite direction. As uncertainty sets in over how long Kyiv’s allies will keep sending billions of dollars for the war, Kuleba said that Washington’s support for Ukraine was not weakening. “We do not feel that the US support has been shattered … because the United States understands that what is at stake in Ukraine is much bigger than just Ukraine,” he told reporters as he greeted Borrell for the summit. “The decision was taken as it was, but we are now working with both sides of the Congress to make sure that it does not repeat again under any circumstances,” Kuleba added. US President Joe Biden on SundayreassuredKyiv and allies of continued financial support for the war effort despite the US Congress’s decision. He pressed congressional Republicans to back the aid, saying he was “sick and tired” of the political brinkmanship that had nearly closed the government down. "
NHS strikes: What ails UK health ser­vice? Doc­tors’ protests or bud­get cuts?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/2/nhs-strikes-what-ails-uk-health-service-doctors-protests-or-budget-cuts,UK doc­tors have be­gun a 72-hour strike to de­mand pay rise and bet­ter work­ing con­di­tions amid cost of liv­ing cri­sis.,"London, United Kingdom– Thousands of doctors across England have started a three-day strike for the eighth timesince March, demanding better pay and working conditions. Consultants and junior doctors – who form 80 percent of hospital doctors – began the 72-hour strike at 7am (06:00 GMT) on Monday, as the ruling Conservative Party convened for its annual meeting in Manchester. The publicly-funded National Health Service (NHS) has warned that the strike will cripple nonemergency services. It will mark the second joint strike by consultants and junior doctors in less than a month, forcing hospitals to reschedule outpatient appointments and nonurgent operations. Nearly a million hospital appointments have been rescheduled since the strike action, including nurses, began in December. Here’s what you need to know about the strike: Doctors say the raises in their salaries have not been keeping up with high inflation amid a cost of living crisis in the UK. The health sector has suffered from staff shortages due to years of funding cuts. This means medical professionals are forced to work longer hours, unsupported, and unable to take breaks. A recent survey by The British Medical Journal found that one in three medical students plan to leave the NHS within two years of graduating.  Add to this, a lack of resources, such as hospital beds and medical equipment, and doctors are left feeling “undervalued and burnt out”, says Dr Kiran Rahim, a junior doctor and a paediatric registrar in a London hospital. She has been providing critical medical care and treatment for sick children since she qualified about a decade ago. She says junior doctors have had real terms (RPI) pay cut of 26.1 percent since 2008. A consultant’s starting basic full-time annual salary is 88,300 pounds ($107,328) and for a junior doctor who has just graduated from medical school it is about 29,384 pounds ($35,716). A survey by the British Medical Association (BMA) the trade union representing doctors in the UK, has said nearly half of junior doctors were struggling to pay their rent or mortgage during the cost of living crisis, and half had difficulty paying their energy bills. Dr Rahim was hoping, by this point in the year, to be able to continue doing a job that she loves, instead of going on her strike. “I want to see the government work with doctors to bring an end to industrial action, but that has repeatedly not happened. Our goodwill has been exploited enough and we’re just done. Formal resolution with the BMA needs to happen.”  Last year, junior doctors were offered an “insulting” pay rise of 2 percent, “well below inflation”, the BMA said. All this culminated in strike action in March this year, with junior doctors demanding a 35 percent pay remuneration, and consultants asking for 12 percent. Now the government has offered 6 percent and 8.8 percent to consultants and junior doctors respectively. Using annual consumer price index (CPI) forecasts, a 6 percent rise would only amount to 1 percent if the rate of inflation is factored in. Doctors have rejected the offer. Professor Phil Banfield, BMA council chair, says doctors are willing to end strikes if the government makes “a credible offer”. “We don’t want to be on strike, we don’t want to have to protest at party conferences, but we do want doctors to be recognised as the highly skilled practitioners of medicine that they are. We want to be serving our patients.”  It is not just doctors’ pay, there has been wage stagnation across the UK economy since the 2008 global financial crisis. The UK’s coalition government led by the Conservatives introduced a series of austerity measures after coming to power in 2010 as a way to respond to the crisis, including a slowdown in NHS spending. But this left the NHS budget short by $28.6bn. Add to this, “soaring inflation, high energy costs, the structural changes and impact of Brexit and an ageing population, you’ve got the perfect storm”, says Professor Nora Colton, director of the Global Business School for Health (GBSH) at University College of London (UCL). Figures for 2021-22 show the government spent 193.8 billion pounds ($236bn) on daily running costs. Nearly 40 percent of the annual budget was spent on staffing, including doctors’ wages. It is not just doctors’ salaries, there have been cuts in services across the country, including hospital and A&E (accidents and emergencies) closures. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine found that long A&E waits – due to a shortage of staff and a lack of hospital beds – contributed to 23,000 excess deaths in 2022. “It’s not that simple”, states Professor Colton, “there are all sorts of systemic issues at play. There were reports that ambulances couldn’t release people into A&E because there weren’t enough bed spaces. There weren’t enough bed spaces because people weren’t being released into social care. People weren’t released into social care, because of funding cuts – it’s very complex. “It’s not easy to say it’s because of budget cuts, it’s just the overall inability to take a systemic approach to healthcare.” NHS is one of the oldest publicly-funded healthcare systems in the world and is comparatively well funded when contrasted with other well-off nations, but its healthoutcomesare below average. The King’s Fund analysis of data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) shows the UK ranked sixth on the list for health expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2022. “The UK spends 10 percent of its GDP on health, yet health outcomes are lower than in other countries. That’s because of health inequality, social inequality, it all exacerbates health outcomes,” explains Colton from UCL. “Pouring more money into hospital care isn’t going to fix things, to do that we need to make sure that primary care, diagnostics and prevention are invested in.” Professor Colton believes the NHS model can be saved if “courageous politicians and visionary leaders” take action. “It’s not just about money, it’s about investing in the right places – into infrastructure, innovation and technology. If we don’t start pivoting to the future towards preventative and diagnostic care, the complex problems the NHS is facing will not get solved. “We need a better understanding of how everything functions together, in a properly funded care model and workforce.” Colton believes doctors should have better working conditions and be financially compensated for their work, “but from a government economic perspective a salary increase is seen as driving forward wage inflation”. Consultants have a legal mandate to keep striking until the end of December and junior doctors until late February. "
"Stars, shocks and tragedies: The his­to­ry of the ICC Crick­et World Cup",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2023/10/2/history-of-the-icc-cricket-world-cup,"Star play­ers, up­sets, and un­for­get­table mo­ments – a roundup of the 47-year his­to­ry of the ICC Crick­et World Cup.","The International Cricket Council (ICC) Men’sCricket World Cuphas witnessed evolving formats, stiff competition, and tense controversies over nearly five decades. The 13th edition of the tournament, being hosted by two-time winners India, will be held from October 5 to November 19 and will see 10 teams vie for the one-day international (ODI) cricket’s most coveted trophy. Here is a look back at the tournament’s 47-year history. The ICC was founded in 1909, with England, Australia, and South Africa as the only members. The three countries played a Test cricket tournament in 1912, but poor weather conditions in England and a lack of public interest meant the competition did not happen again. Teams around the world continued to play bilaterally until the ODI format gained popularity in the 1960s, following its introduction in English county cricket. The first Cricket World Cup of any kind was a women’s tournament organised in 1973 by the International Women’s Cricket Council, which later merged with the ICC. Hosts:England Winners:West Indies As the only country with enough resources to host the event, England eventually organised the first Men’s Cricket World Cup in 1975 with eight teams in the competition and the ODI format in its fifth year. The six Test-playing nations at the time – Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan and the West Indies – were joined by Sri Lanka and a composite team from East Africa. South Africa, one of the strongest teams in world cricket, were serving a ban from international cricket over the country’s apartheid-era policies. The tournament was played in white kits, with red balls and in a 60-overs-a-side format. The West Indies defeated Australia by 17 runs to win the trophy in the final at Lord’s. Amid the celebrations, which saw fans pour down to the field, a pitch invader stole famous British umpire Dickie Bird’s hat. Hosts:England Winners:West Indies Based on the success of the inaugural competition, the World Cup became a recurring event on the international cricket calendar and was mooted to be held every four years. The competition stayed in England, who made it to the final but lost to the defending champions West Indies by 92 runs. England’s leading bowler Bob Willis missed the final match due to an injury that he suffered in the semifinal. Star West Indies batter Viv Richards was awarded man of the match for his 138 runs from 157 balls. Hosts:England Winners:India Breaking the West Indies’ shot at treble, India’s 1983 World Cup win made them a force to be reckoned with and their captain Kapil Dev a household name in his country. In what is considered an iconic moment in the tournament’s history, Kapil Dev ran backwards to complete a catch that saw Richards dismissed for 33 as India completed a 43-run win. In a famous statement, David Frith, then-editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly, said: “Show me a person who gave Kapil Dev’s team any chance of winning the 1983 World Cup and I will show you a liar and an opportunist.” The Indian team’s 1983 World Cup win became a famous underdogs story and was depicted in the 2021 Bollywood film titled 83. Hosts:India and Pakistan Winners:Australia For the first time, the tournament was held outside England as it switched to a 50-over format to adjust to fewer daylight hours in the Indian subcontinent. After having three tournaments with all-English umpires, this World Cup was the first to feature neutral umpires. Australia and England faced off in one of the closest World Cup finals at the famous Eden Gardens stadium in Kolkata, then known as Calcutta, after defeating co-hosts Pakistan and India in their respective semifinals. Australia beat England by seven runs and David Boon was named player of the match for his 75 runs. Pretournament favourites West Indies did not advance past the group stage. Hosts:Australia and New Zealand Winners:Pakistan As the tournament returned after five years and moved Down Under for the first time, it brought several changes: coloured kits, white balls and day-night matches played under floodlights. It was also the first World Cup to include television replays and the use of a third umpire to adjudicate run-out appeals. With the end of apartheid, South Africa returned to international cricket and were included in the tournament for the first time, increasing the number of teams to nine. They advanced to a memorable semifinal, where a controversial “rain rule” left them needing 22 runs off one ball when play resumed after a rain delay. In a defining moment for Pakistani cricket, Imran Khan led his team of self-styled “cornered tigers” to a 22-run victory over England. Hosts:India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka Winners:Sri Lanka Sri Lanka joined second-time organisers India and Pakistan as co-hosts in the midst of a civil war in the island nation. The tournament was hit by a controversy before it began, as several countries refused to play in Sri Lanka. Australia and West Indies forfeited their matches in Colombo after a bombing at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in the capital three weeks before the tournament. The ICC then awarded two points to Sri Lanka, who became the first team to qualify for the quarterfinals. Controversies continued to plague the tournament. An unruly crowd in Kolkota disrupted India’s semifinal against Sri Lanka when the hosts lost their eighth wicket. Meanwhile, Pakistani cricketer Wasim Akram’s house in Lahore was stoned by an angry mob after he pulled out of Pakistan’s quarterfinal against India citing an injury. In the final at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium, Sri Lanka’s Aravinda De Silva and captain Arjuna Ranatunga guided the team home in a chase of 242 against Australia and brought their first World Cup title. Hosts:England Winners:Australia The World Cup returned to England after a 16-year hiatus and was held a year early to avoid a clash with the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. The number of teams increased to 12, with Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, Kenya, and Scotland joining the lineup. Pretournament favourites Australia and Pakistan met in the final, which turned out to be a one-sided match after Pakistan were bowled out for 132 runs, setting off Australia’s treble run in the tournament. Hosts:South Africa Winners:Australia The first World Cup to be held on the African continent saw star Indian batter Sachin Tendulkar shine with 673 runs, and Australia play without legendary spinner Shane Warne as he served a ban after testing positive for a prohibited drug. Australia beat India by 125 runs in the final in Johannesburg. Hosts:West Indies Winners:Australia It was a World Cup beset by controversy, tragedy and upsets. Pakistan’s South African coach Bob Woolmer was found dead in his hotel room a day after his side’s shocking three-wicket loss to Ireland in the group stage. Following Woolmer’s death, organisers imposed restrictions on music and celebrations in the stands. Bangladesh shocked India by beating them by five wickets in the group stage. India and Pakistan failed to progress to the Super Eight stage. Australia continued their golden run in the tournament and bagged their fourth title after beating Sri Lanka by 53 runs. Hosts:India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka Winners:India India became the first team to win the World Cup on home soil after beating Sri Lanka in the final by six wickets in the first all-Asian final. Australia’s 12-year reign came to an end with a quarterfinal loss to India, who went on to beat Pakistan in an enthralling semifinal in Mohali. Pakistan lost hosting rights for the tournament due to security concerns after the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked by armed men in Lahore on a 2009 tour. Hosts:Australia and New Zealand Winners:Australia The two host nations faced off at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, with Australia eventually emerging as the victors in a one-sided final. New Zealand’s Martin Guptill set a new world record for most runs in an ODI innings scoring 237 runs in the quarterfinal against the West Indies. Hosts:England and Wales Winners:England In one of the greatest ODI matches in the game’s history, the last World Cup ended with a tied final match between England and New Zealand at Lord’s Cricket Ground. The match went into a super over but that too ended in a tie and England were awarded the win based on the boundary countback rule. In other milestones, Australia’s fast bowler Michael Starc claimed the most wickets in a competition with 27 dismissals. The number of competing teams fell to 10."

Katalin Kariko is a professor at Sagan’s University in Hungary and an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Drew Weissman conducted his prizewinning research together with Kariko at the University of Pennsylvania. The pair will receive their prize, consisting of a diploma, a gold medal and a $1m cheque, from King Carl XVI Gustaf at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of scientist Alfred Nobel who created the prizes in his last will and testament. The frontrunners for this year’s award in medicine included Kevan Shokat, an American biologist who figured out how to block the KRAS cancer gene behind a third of cancers, including challenging-to-treat lung, colon, and pancreatic tumours. Two American biologists, Stanislas Leibler and Michael Elowitz, were also in the run for their work on synthetic gene circuits which established the field of synthetic biology. It enables scientists to redesign organisms by engineering them to have new abilities. The Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine was won last year by Swedish scientistSvante Paabofor discoveries in human evolution that unlocked secrets of Neanderthal DNA which provided key insights into our immune system, including our vulnerability to severe COVID-19. The physics prize will be announced on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday and the economics award on October 9."
Mex­i­co church roof col­laps­es dur­ing bap­tism killing at least 10 peo­ple,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/2/mexico-church-roof-collapses-during-baptism-killing-at-least-10-people,Three chil­dren are among the dead and dozens are in­jured in the in­ci­dent in Ciu­dad Madero in the Tamauli­pas state.,"At least 10 people, including three children, have been killed and dozens more injured in Mexico after the roof of a church came crashing down during a baptism ceremony, according to local officials. The incident occurred the northeastern coastal town of Ciudad Madero in the Tamaulipas state on Sunday. Working under floodlights, military personnel supported emergency services using rescue dogs and earthmoving equipment to identify and dig out survivors from the ruins of the church. “Unfortunately, 10 people are confirmed dead. Of these, five are women, two men and three children,” Americo Villarreal, governor of Tamaulipas, told reporters at the scene. Rescue workers were attempting to recover the body of a woman from the rubble, but the death toll was not expected to rise as all of the missing had been accounted for, he added. At least 60 people were treated for injuries, Villarreal said, with 23 were still in hospital. “Two have serious injuries, their lives may be in danger,” he added. Jose Armando Alvarez, the bishop of the local diocese, said in a video posted on social media that “the roof of a church has collapsed during the celebration of the Eucharist”. Several ambulances, patrol cars, and police and military personnel were at the site, in addition to numerous people in search of family members who were in the church. Local media showed footage of dozens of people trying to hold up part of the collapsed structure with poles while others made their way through the wreckage in search of survivors. Rescuers could be seen raising their fists in the air as a call for silence so they might hear any calls for help coming from people stuck under the wreckage. The Archdiocese of Mexico posted a message on social media offering condolences. “We join in prayer with our sister diocese Tampico to intercede for our killed and injured brothers,” it said. Local residents put out calls on social media asking for tools to aid the rescue effort, such as hydraulic lifts, wood and hammers. Ciudad Madero is a town of just more than 200,000 people on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico."

People eligible for early voting in the Northern Territory, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia will be able to cast their ballots from Monday, while voters in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory will be able to do so from Tuesday. The referendum itself is scheduled for October 14, and voting is compulsory. As early voting began, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese hit the streets of Melbourne, the capital of Victoria, to rally support for the “yes” vote. “I sincerely think the key to the next fortnight is those one-on-one conversations with people to accept this request of the overwhelming majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples,” he told reporters. The proposal asks Australians whether the country’s constitution should be altered to enshrine an Indigenous advisory body called the “Voice to Parliament”. Supporters say embedding the “Voice” in the constitution would recognise Indigenous people’s special place in Australian history while giving them input into government policies. Opponents argue it would divide Australians along racial lines without reducing the severe inequalities faced by Indigenous people.  The proposal, backed by Albanese’s Labor government, has beenstruggling to get majority support, with recent opinion polls showing voters will reject it. A survey published by the Australian Financial Review on September 25 showed that support for the “Voice” hadfallen to 33 percent, down by 15 points since May. The “no” vote was at 50 percent. Some voters who had switched their stance said the Voice was a distraction from their two biggest concerns – the cost of living and the price of housing. But Albanese said he remained optimistic that the proposal would pass despite the poor showing in polls. Volunteers for the Yes Campaign were also out in Melbourne, with officials saying there was still a chance to turn public opinion around. “As with any election, Australians tend to really put their focus into their decision-making much closer to the vote, so 12 days out, there’s plenty of time for us to have that conversation,” Dean Parkin, the director of the Yes23 Campaign, told Sky News. “There is a very clear choice in this referendum, a ‘yes’ vote gives us real recognition and a chance for practical change, whereas a ‘no’ vote gives us absolutely nothing,” he added. Australia has no treaty with its Indigenous people, who make up about 3.2 percent of its 26 million population. They were marginalised by British colonial rulers and are not mentioned in the 122-year-old constitution. They remain the most disadvantaged group in the country. Indigenous people have a life expectancy of about eight years less than non-Indigenous Australians and suffer disproportionately high rates of suicide, domestic violence andimprisonment. The “yes” campaign faces significant odds. A referendum to change the constitution requires what is known as a double majority – the support of most Australians nationwide plus a majority of voters in a majority of states. Of the 44 referendums held since the constitution took effect in 1901, only eight have been carried and none since 1977. Five referendums have failed because while they were supported by most Australians, they fell short of gaining majorities in at least four of the six states."
Trump says he will be in New York court for tri­al on his busi­ness prac­tices,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/2/trump-says-he-will-be-in-new-york-court-for-trial-on-his-business-practices,Judge has al­ready ruled Trump and his two sons com­mit­ted fraud in over­stat­ing the val­ue of their busi­ness em­pire.,"Former United States President Donald Trump has said he will attend court in New York for the start of a civil trial in a case that has already resulted in a judge ruling that hecommitted fraudin his business dealings. The trial is due to getunder way on Monday, threatening Trump’s business empire as he campaigns for the White House with four criminal cases looming. “I’m going to Court tomorrow morning to fight for my name and reputation,” Trump wrote on Sunday night on his Truth Social platform. The 77-year-old lashed out at New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is suing him, and Judge Arthur Engoron, who is presiding over the non-jury trial and ruled last week that Trump and his sons Eric and Don Jr had beeninflatingthe value of the Trump Organization’s property and financial assets for years. “THIS WHOLE CASE IS SHAM!!!” Trump wrote. “See you in Court – Monday morning.” Trump’s visit to court on Monday willmark a departurefrom his usual practice. He did not attend court as either a witness or a spectator when his company and one of its top executives were convicted of tax fraud last year. Nor did he go to court during a trial earlier this year in which a jury found him liable forsexually assaultingthe writer E Jean Carroll in a department store dressing room.  Trump also faces several major criminal trials in the months ahead. He is scheduled to appear before a federal judge in Washington, DC on March 4, on charges oftrying to overturnthe outcome of the 2020 presidential election won by Joe Biden. After that, Trump will be back in New York state court, this time on criminal hush money charges, and later in a Florida federal court, where he is accused of mishandling classified documents after leaving office. Finally, he will also have to answer tostate charges in Georgia, where prosecutors say Trump illegally tried to get the southern state’s 2020 election results changed in his favour. In the New York civil case, Engoron ruled that Trump, his two eldest sons and other executives lied to tax collectors, lenders and insurers to exaggerate the value of their properties by $812m to $2.2bn between 2014 and 2021. As a result, the judge revoked the business licences that allowed the Trump Organization to operate some of its New York properties.  Actually enforcing such penalties would be “a major blow to Donald Trump’s ability to do business in the State of New York going forward,” Will Thomas, a professor of business law at the University of Michigan, told the AFP news agency. According to James, the New York attorney general, Trump’s apartment is among the spaces that were fraudulently overvalued by being listed as three times bigger than its true size. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida – the site of the classified documents drama – and several of his golf clubs are also part of James’s complaint. Trump has repeatedly dismissed the New York civil allegations. There are likely to be dozens of witnesses called to testify at the trial, including Trump himself, although that might not happen for several weeks. Engoron has said the trial could continue into December."
UK awards $4bn con­tract to build AUKUS nu­clear sub­marines,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/2/uk-awards-4bn-contract-to-build-aukus-nuclear-submarines,"SSN-AUKUS ‘will be largest, most ad­vanced and most pow­er­ful at­tack sub­marines ever op­er­at­ed’ by Roy­al Navy, UK says.","The United Kingdom has awarded three UK companies a 4 billion pound ($4.9bn) contract to design and manufacture a nuclear-powered attack submarine as part of the country’s AUKUS programme with Australia and the United States. The UK Ministry of Defence, in a statement on Sunday, said the contract with BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce and Babcock “represents a significant milestone for both the UK and the trilateral AUKUS programme as a whole”. The new submarines, known as SSN-AUKUS, “will be the largest, most advanced and most powerful attack submarines ever operated” by the Royal Navy and will “combine world-leading sensors, design and weaponry in one vessel”, it said. The first of the submarines will be delivered into service in the UK in the late 2030s and the first Australian ones will follow in the early 2040s. Theplans for SSN-AUKUSwere unveiled in March by the leaders of Australia, the UK and US and came as the three countries ramp up their efforts to counter China in the Asia Pacific region. The nuclear-powered vessels – which have far greater stealth and range and mark the first time Washington has shared nuclear-propulsion technology with a country other than the UK – represent a significant upgrade to Australia’s current diesel-powered fleet. Australian Defence Minister Richard Marles previously described the AUKUS deal as “the biggest step forward in our military capability that we’ve had since the end of World War II”. Under AUKUS, Washington also intends to sell Canberra up to five of its Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines in the early 2030s. It will also see US and UK submarines deployed in Western Australia as soon as 2027 to help train Australian crews. Analysts say the AUKUS programme will strengthen deterrence in the face of China’s increasingly assertive actions in the Pacific, including in theSouth China Seawhere it has built military bases on disputed outcrops and reefs. “As highly stealthy platforms, SSNs’ ability to operate in contested waters, hunt Chinese warships and submarines, control strategic sea lanes and chokepoints, and project power with long-range cruise missiles make them one of the most effective ways to complicate Chinese military planning and give Beijing a reason to take pause before using force,” wrote Ashley Townshend, a senior fellow for Indo-Pacific security at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank, in a commentary in March. “The fact that US, UK, and, in time, Australian SSNs will be operating as a combined force—with Aussies also embedded on American and British subs—raises the specter of horizontal escalation by forcing Beijing to consider the prospect that military action against any SSN, or the submarine base itself, could trigger the involvement of all three nations,” he added. China has meanwhile condemned AUKUS as an illegal act of nuclear proliferation. Its foreign ministry has accused Australia, the UK and US of travelling “further down the wrong and dangerous path for their own geopolitical self-interest”. The AUKUS pact arises from a “Cold War mentality which will only motivate an arms race, damage the international nuclear proliferation regime, and harm regional stability and peace”, it said."
Fire at po­lice com­plex in Egypt’s Is­mail­ia con­tained af­ter hours,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/2/huge-fire-engulfs-police-complex-in-egypts-ismailia,The cause of the mas­sive blaze that re­port­ed­ly wound­ed at least 38 peo­ple is not yet known.,"A huge fire that erupted at a police complex in the Egyptian city of Ismailia and wounded at least 38 people has been contained after several hours, according to state media. No fatalities were immediately reported over the blaze that happened early on Monday, but hospitals were placed on alert. The cause of the blaze, which broke out at the headquarters of the Ismailia Security Directorate before dawn, is not yet known. Of 26 wounded who were transferred to a local hospital, 24 had suffered from “asphyxiation” and two from burns, local media reported citing the health ministry. Videos on social media showed flames soaring from the city’s security directorate early, and it appeared the building’s main facade had collapsed.  Translation: A huge fire engulfs the Ismailia Security Directorate. The health ministry deployed 50 ambulances to the scene, which were joined by military emergency services including two planes, according to state media. Later on Monday, state television announced that the fire was contained. Sara Kira, the founder and director of the European North African Center for Research, said Egyptians were wary of possible attacks before the presidential polls in December 2023. “We do not want any turbulence before the elections,” she told Al Jazeera from Cairo. Hopefully it is not the start of something ugly, but just an accident, she said. Deadly fires are a common hazard in Egypt, where many buildings are dilapidated and poorly maintained. In August 2022, a fire caused by a short circuit killed 41 worshippers in a Cairo church, prompting calls to improve the country’s infrastructure and the response time of the fire brigade. In March 2021, at least 20 people died in a fire at a textile factory in the capital, while in 2020, two hospital fires killed fourteen people. "
Anger and de­spair as In­done­sian fam­i­lies mark year since foot­ball dis­as­ter,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/2/anger-and-despair-as-indonesian-families-mark-year-since-football-disaster,Some 135 peo­ple died af­ter po­lice fired tear gas into the stands of the Kan­ju­ruhan Sta­di­um.,"The Indonesian families of those who died in theKanjuruhan Stadium disasterin Malang a year ago have marked the anniversary of the tragedy along with hundreds of fans and survivors at a candlelit vigil at the stadium amid renewed calls for justice. About 300 people travelled by convoy from the centre of Malang to Kanjuruhan Stadium, with some venturing inside for the first time since last year’s disaster when 135 people were killed, including children as young as three years old. More than 400 people were injured. Rini Hanifa, however, could not bring herself to enter the place where her 20-year-old son, Agus Rian Syah Pratama Putra, had died. “Some of the victim’s families, including me, couldn’t stand it and some people fainted. I felt as if I couldn’t breathe,” she told Al Jazeera. The prayer vigil started at 12pm on Sunday and carried on late into the night. The sense of injustice was palpable as parts of the stadium – now in the process of being rebuilt to FIFA specifications – were set alight and flames blazed across the pitch. For Hanifa, however, the experience of being at Kanjuruhan was overwhelming. She went home early. “I just stood outside gate 13 and thought about how my child must have felt as he struggled to breathe and couldn’t because of the tear gas,” she said. “We were all just imagining how our children died in there, screaming for help because their lungs were burning.” The tragedy occurred when Indonesian police fired tear gas into the stands and onto the pitch after a game between local rivals Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya. Police thought there had been a pitch invasion by Arema fans, some of whom had climbed down onto the field after their team lost to Persebaya for the first time in 23 years. Persebaya fans had not been allowed to attend the game because of the intense rivalry between the two sides and fears of violence. According to anofficial reportby Indonesia’s National Human Rights Commission (Komnas HAM), police fired some 45 rounds of tear gas inside the stadium leading to the deaths of supporters in the stands and in a crush at the exits as fans desperately tried to escape. Under FIFA, the international soccer federation, rules, the use of tear gas is prohibited inside stadiums. Usman Hamid, the head of Amnesty International’s Indonesia office, told Al Jazeera that even now, the Indonesian police appeared not to have reassessed the use of tear gas against civilians. “What is unfortunate is that, since the Kanjuruhan tragedy, cases of tear gas shooting by police officers at civilians have continued to occur, as happened onRempang Islandon September 7,” he said, referring to protests last month against a China-led development project. “We urge the authorities that the use of force and tactics by security forces must always be within the legal framework and in accordance with human rights standards. We also urge the authorities to increase transparency, accountability, and the changes needed to protect civil society from excessive and potentially dangerous use of force, including tear gas.” Following the Kanjuruhan tragedy, two civilians, security officer Suko Sutrisno and match organising committee chairman Abdul Haris, were sentenced to one year and 18 months in prison respectively for negligence, including failing to carry out a proper risk assessment of the stadium. Wahyu Setyo Pranoto, the chief of operations of the Malang Regency Police and Bambang Sidik Achmadi, the head of the Prevention Unit of the Malang Regency Police, meanwhile, were sentenced to two and two and a half years in prison respectively on appeal. The two men wereoriginally acquitted. Hasdarmawan, the commander of the Third Mobile Brigade Company of the East Java Police, was sentenced to one and a half years in prison for his role in the incident. However, many of the families and human rights groups feel justice remains elusive not only because of the comparatively light sentences, but also the failure to prosecute other police officers and match officials further up the chain of command. Daniel Siagian, the head of the Legal Aid Institute in Malang, told Al Jazeera that the Kanjuruhan Stadium tragedy was a “black mark against human rights and football in Indonesia”. “This tragedy confirms that the state is ignoring responsibility to resolve this case fairly and with dignity. This incident clearly demonstrated excessive use of force and acts of brutality displayed by the security forces,” he said. He added that the incident showed Indonesia’s National Police had yet to fully understand and respect fundamental human rights principles. Devi Athok, whose daughters, 16-year-old Natasya Debi Ramadhani and 13-year-old Naila Debi Anggraini, died last October, went to the stadium on Sunday afternoon and strung a banner with their faces on it between the goalposts to demand further accountability for their deaths. He also sat in the spot where their bodies were found in the 13th tribune. “I felt like I was sitting with them. I cried because I felt how they must have been tormented by the gas after the police fired it,” he said. He added that he briefly lost consciousness after becoming overwhelmed with grief and the stress of visiting the stadium. “I sat in the tribune where they had sat for the last time and I apologised to my two girls,” he said. “I told them: ‘Please forgive me, Daddy couldn’t save you’.”"
"Wag­n­er’s Prigozhin hailed a hero, 40 days af­ter death in plane crash",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/2/wagners-prigozhin-hailed-a-hero-40-days-after-death-in-plane-crash,Dozens pay re­spects in sev­er­al Russ­ian cities on key date for mourn­ing in the East­ern Or­tho­dox church.,"Dozens of Russians from family to former fighters have held memorial services for Wagner mercenary group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin to mark 40 days since his death, hailing him as a hero of the people. Prigozhin was killed when his private jet crashed on its way from Moscow to St Petersburg on August 23, two months after he led afailed mutinyon Moscow. Two other top Wagner commanders, Prigozhin’s four bodyguards and the plane’s three crew were also killed in the still-unexplained crash.  At the 62-year-old’s grave in St Petersburg, his mother, Violetta, and his son, Pavel, laid flowers. Supporters waved the black flags of Wagner which sport a skull and the motto “Blood, Honour, Motherland, Courage”. In the Eastern Orthodox church, it is believed that the soul makes its final journey to either heaven or hell on the 40th day after death. Memorials also took place in Moscow and other Russian cities with dozens of Wagner fighters and everyday Russians paying their respects. There was no coverage on Russian state television or any official tributes. Wagner fighters have played a key role in the fighting in Ukraine, helping Russia capture the eastern town of Bakhmut in May after weeks of bruising battles. Wagner, whose troops were moved to camps in Belarus as part of a deal to end the mutiny, was also active in a number of African countries. “He can be criticised for certain events, but he was a patriot who defended the motherland’s interests on different continents,” Wagner’s recruitment arm said ofPrigozhinin a statement on Telegram. “He was charismatic and importantly he was close to the fighters and to the people. And that’s why he became popular both in Russia and abroad.” Prigozhin’s mutiny, which followed months of expletive-laden videos insulting Russia’s top military officials, was arguably the biggest challenge to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s rule since the former KGB spy rose to power in 1999. The Wagner troops took over the southern city of Rostov, shot down several Russian aircraft and advanced towards Moscow before turning back 200 km (125 miles) from the capital following a purported deal brokered by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko. Mourners spoke of respect for Prigozhin, who got to know Putin while running a restaurant business in St Petersburg in the 1990s. He went on to win lucrative state catering contracts earning him the nickname, “Putin’s chef” and expanded into media as well as an infamous internet “troll factory” that led to his indictment in the United States for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Wagner brought him further into the limelight with themercenary groupdeveloping a reputation for brutality and ruthlessness. “He was a real authority, a leader,” Mikhail, a soldier in Russia’s armed forces who refused to give his second name, told the Reuters news agency. Moscow resident Marta, who also refused to give her surname, said the people believed in Prigozhin but that Wagner had been “decapitated” by the deaths of him and co-founder Dmitry Utkin, a former special forces officer and aNazi sympathiser. Prigozhin was also supposed to have moved to Belarus as part of the deal to end the mutiny. Russia looks set to continue using Wagner units despite the recent turmoil. On Friday, the Kremlin said Putin had told Andrei Troshev, one of Wagner’s top commanders, that he should “deal with forming volunteer units that could perform various combat tasks, primarily in the zone of the special military operation” – a term Moscow uses for its war in Ukraine."

The accident took place early on Sunday in the Mexican state of Chiapas near the border with Guatemala. A source in the prosecutor’s office who spoke on grounds of anonymity told AFP news agency the victims were apparently from Cuba and all were women, including one minor. The incident occurred on a stretch of highway along the Pacific coast between the towns of Pijijiapan and Tonala, where people often travel as they attempt to reach the United States. The truck, whose body was partially built of wood, was destroyed, with the migrants’ clothes, bags and backpacks strewn around it.  Thousands of migrants from different countries travel across Mexico in buses, trailers and freight trains as they head for the US. It was the second fatal crash in less than a week involving migrants in Mexico. On Thursday, two migrants died when a truck overturned in the municipality of Mezcalapa, also in Chiapas state. In August, at least 15 people were killed when a crowded bus carrying primarily Venezuelan migrants and asylum seekers collided with a trailer on a highway in Mexico that connects the states of Puebla and Oaxaca, a route known to be used by migrant smugglers. In July, another bus in Oaxaca plunged off a steep road, killing as many as27 people. Another 18 people were killed in a crash in April. And in February, migrants from Venezuela, Colombia, and Central America were involved in a bus crash, again between Oaxaca and Puebla, that left at least 17 dead. Crashes are just one of the many perils migrants and asylum seekers face as they journey north to the US-Mexico border, a common destination. Many must also confront dangerous jungle passages, criminal gangs, and the risk ofextended detention. "
"Ser­bia de­nies US, EU re­ports of mil­i­tary build-up along Koso­vo bor­der",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/1/serbia-denies-us-eu-reports-of-military-build-up-along-kosovo-border,Pres­i­dent Alek­san­dar Vu­cic’s state­ment comes af­ter shootout kills four peo­ple and fu­els ten­sions in volatile Balka­ns.,"Serbia has denied reports of a military build-up along the border with Kosovo, alleging a “campaign of lies” against his country in the wake of a shootout a week earlier that killed four people and fuelled tensions in the volatile Balkan region. “A campaign of lies … has been launched against our Serbia,” Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said in a video posted on Instagram on Sunday. “They have lied a lot about the presence of our military forces …. In fact, they are bothered that Serbia has what they describe as sophisticated weapons.” Earlier this week, the United States urged Belgrade to pull its forces back from the border with Kosovo after detecting what it called an “unprecedented” Serbian military build-up. Serbiadeployed sophisticated tanksand artillery on the border after deadly clashes erupted at a monastery in northern Kosovo last week, the White House warned. The European Union also expressed similar concerns. Kosovo’s government on Saturday said it was monitoring the movements of the Serbian military from “three different directions”. It also urged Serbia to immediately pull back its troops and demilitarise the border area. Clashes last week erupted when heavily armed Serb gunmen ambushed a patrol a few miles from the Serbian border,killing a Kosovo police officer. Several dozen assailants then barricaded themselves in an Orthodox monastery, sparking an hour-long firefight in which three gunmen were killed and three were arrested. Kosovo’s government hasaccused Belgradeof backing the operation. Serbia denied Kosovo’s allegations that it trained the group of some 30 men who opened fire on police officers. Kosovo also said it was investigating possible Russian involvement in the violence. Serbia is Russia’s main ally in Europe, and there are fears in the West that Moscow could try to stir trouble in the Balkans to avert attention from the war in Ukraine. The clash was one of the worst since Kosovo broke away from Serbia in a bloody war in 1998-99 and declared independence in 2008, promptingNATOto announce it would beef up a peacekeeping force stationed in the country. Vucic has several times in recent months raised the combat readiness level of Serbian troops on the border with Kosovo. Serbia also has been reinforcing its troops with weapons and other equipment mainly purchased from Russia and China. “We will continue to invest in the defence of our country but Serbia wants peace,” the Serbian leader said on Sunday. “Everything they said they made up and lied, and they knew they were making up and lying.” "
Biden says US ‘will not walk away’ from Ukraine amid bud­get tur­moil,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/1/biden-says-us-will-not-walk-away-from-ukraine-amid-budget-turmoil,US pres­i­dent re­as­sures al­lies and Kyiv af­ter last-minute bud­get deal in Con­gress axes fund­ing for the war-torn coun­try.,"United States President Joe Biden says aid to Ukraine will keep flowing for now as he seeks to reassure allies of continued support for the war effort. But time is running out, the president said on Sunday in a warning to Congress, which has voted to avert a government shutdown by passing a short-term funding package that dropped assistance forUkraine in the fight against Russia. “We cannot under any circumstances allow American support for Ukraine to be interrupted,” Biden said. “We have time, not much time and there is an overwhelming sense of urgency,” he said, noting that the funding bill lasts only until mid-November. Biden urged the Congress to negotiate an aid package as soon as possible. “The vast majority of both parties – Democrats and Republicans, Senate and House – support helping Ukraine and the brutal aggression that is being thrust upon them by Russia,” he said in an address from the White House. “Stop playing games. Get this done,” Biden said, adding that he expected Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to secure passage of a separate bill for Ukraine funding soon. “I want to assure our American allies, the American people and the people in Ukraine that you can count on our support. We will not walk away,” he said.  Despite Biden’s attempts to reassure Kyiv, the future of US aid for Ukraine hangs in the balance after a last-gasp deal to avoid a government shutdown. Although the compromise struck in Congress late on Sunday dropped new funding for Ukraine amid opposition from hardline Republicans, it remains unclear what might happen next. Biden and his Democratic party say the US has a duty to help Ukraine stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion, warning that failure to do so could embolden other nations in the future. But the issue has become so politicised in Washington that the fate of vital military aid is now in jeopardy, just as Kyiv tries to make progress in its sluggish counteroffensive before winter sets in. The US has been a major supporter of Ukraine after Russia invaded it last year, and Biden has sought to rally the world, as well as his own country, to maintain that support. Biden assured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a visit to Washington last month that strong US support for his war to repel Russian invaders would be maintained despite opposition from some Republican lawmakers. Biden urged Republicans to move ahead quickly to avoid another crisis in November. “The brinkmanship has to end. And there shouldn’t be another … crisis,” he said. “I strongly urge my Republican friends in Congress not to wait. Don’t waste time as you did all summer. Pass a year-long budget agreement. Honour the deal we made a few months ago.” Biden declined to weigh in on whether Democrats should support McCarthy if he needed their votes to keep his job as House speaker. The president said he would leave that to Democratic leaders in the Congress to decide. The US has approved four rounds of aid to Ukraine in response to Russia’s invasion, totaling about $113bn, with some of that money going towards replenishment of US military equipment that was sent to the front lines. In August, Biden called on Congress to provide for an additional $24bn."
Turkey says PKK tar­gets in north Iraq de­stroyed af­ter Ankara sui­cide at­tack,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/1/banned-kurdish-group-pkk-claims-responsibility-for-turkey-suicide-attack,"Air strikes in north­ern Iraq de­stroy Kur­dish tar­gets af­ter the bomb­ing in the cap­i­tal, says Turk­ish in­te­ri­or min­istry.","Turkey says its warplanes have carried out raids on Kurdish targets in northern Iraq following a suicide attack on a government building in capital Ankara. A Turkish interior ministry statement on Sunday said about 20 targets of the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) group were “destroyed” in the aerial operation, including caves, shelters and depots. The military ramped up air strikes in Iraq’s PKK bases in Gara, Hakurk, Metina and Qandil, the statement said. Iraqi President Abdul-Latif Rashid on Monday said in an interview with Saudi Arabian state-owned broadcaster Al-Hadath that his country does not accept the repeated Turkish strikes or the presence of Turkish bases in the Kurdistan region and hopes to come to an agreement with Turkey to solve this problem. It was not clear if the interview was filmed before or after Turkey’s latest strikes. Sunday’s strikes came hours after a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device near an entrance of the interior ministry building in Ankara, injuring two police officers. A second assailant was killed in a shootout with police. A news agency close to the PKK said the group claimed responsibility for thesuicide attack. A statement from the ANF news agency said the PKK planned the bombing to coincide with the opening of the parliament. It said the attack was carried out by “a team of ours linked to our Immortals Battalion” group. The PKK is designated as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. According to the state-run Anadolu Agency, the two attackers had seized the vehicle from a veterinarian in the central province of Kayseri, a city 260km (161 miles) southeast of Ankara. CCTV footage showed a vehicle pulling up to the interior ministry’s main gate and one of its occupants quickly walking towards the building before being engulfed in an explosion, while the other remains on the street. The blast killed one of the attackers and authorities “neutralised”, or killed, the other, the interior minister said of the incident that rattled a central district that is home to ministerial buildings and nearby parliament.  The suicide attack occurred hours before the Turkish parliament was set to reopen after its three-month summer recess with an address by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who said the blast was “the latest attempt” to inflict terror on the Turks. “Those who threaten the peace and security of citizens have not achieved their goals and never will,” he said. The PKK and ISIL (ISIS) have carried out such attacks in tourist areas and city centres of Turkey in the past. Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbul, saidsecurity was tightenedaround the parliament and interior ministry buildings after the attack. “They [authorities] have cleared the area … There is damage on the security entrance of the ministry and workers are trying to fix the damages. There is also a Turkish flag by the gate to express solidarity and the territorial integrity of the country,” she said. The bomb on Ataturk Boulevard was the first in Ankara since March 2016, when 37 people were killed after a bomb-laden car exploded at a crowded central transport hub. Police said they carried out controlled explosions for “suspicious package incidents” in other parts of Ankara. The incident came almost a year after six people were killed and 81 wounded in an explosion in a busy pedestrian street in central Istanbul. Turkey blamed Kurdish fighters for that. During a series of bloody incidents in 2015 and 2016, Kurdish, ISIL and other groups either claimed or were blamed for several attacks in major Turkish cities. Turkey’s parliament is expected to consider ratifying Sweden’s bid to join NATO in the coming weeks after Ankara raised initial objections and delayed the enlargement of the bloc. Erdogan did not mention Sweden or NATO, but told members of parliament that agreeing on a new constitution was a priority for the new session. The parliament speaker said its agenda would not surrender to “terror”. European Council President Charles Michel said he strongly condemned the “terrorist attack”, while EU Commissioner for Enlargement Oliver Varhelyi said the EU supports Turkey “in its fight against terrorism”."
"UN team in Nagorno-Karabakh, a first in 30 years, as eth­nic Ar­me­ni­ans flee",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/1/un-team-in-nagorno-karabakh-a-first-in-30-years-as-ethnic-armenians-flee,The vis­it marks the first time in about three decades that the in­ter­na­tion­al body has gained ac­cess to the re­gion.,"A United Nations mission has arrived in Nagorno-Karabakh during a mass exodus of ethnic Armenians from the region after Azerbaijan recaptured the breakaway enclave last month. An Azerbaijani presidency spokesman said the UN mission arrived in the region on Sunday morning, mainly to assess humanitarian needs. The mission, led by a senior UN aid official, is the global body’s first access to the region in about 30 years. Armenia has asked the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to order Azerbaijan to withdraw all its troops from civilian establishments in Nagorno-Karabakh and give the UN access. The ICJ in February ordered Azerbaijan to ensure free movement through an area known as the Lachin Corridor leading to and from the region. The World Health Organization on Sunday said well over 100,000ethnic Armeniansfrom Nagorno-Karabakh had travelled to neighbouring Armenia. Armenian separatists, who had controlled the region for three decades, agreed to disarm, dissolve their government and reintegrate with Baku following aone-day Azerbaijani offensivelast week. The end of Karabakh’s separatist bid dealt a heavy blow to a centuries-old dream by Armenians of reuniting what they say are their ancestral lands, divided among regional powers since the Middle Ages. Nearly all of Karabakh’s estimated 120,000 residents fled the territory over the following days, sparking a refugee crisis. Reporting from the Nagorno-Karabakh city that is called Stepanakert by Armenians and Khankendi by Azerbaijanis, Al Jazeera’s Osama Bin Javaid said tens of thousands of people deserted the area in the past few days in what can only be described as a “mass exodus”.  “Here in the town centre, if I go quiet, you will be able to hear nothing,” he said. “There is absolutely no one who is left here apart from some disabled and elderly.” “A ghost town with no soul,” said Javaid, describing all that has been left behind. The Azerbaijani presidency said Baku’s migration service has begun operating in the city to register Armenian residents to ensure their “sustainable reintegration … into the Azerbaijani society,” promising them the “patronage of the Azerbaijani state”. Nazeli Baghdasaryan, a spokeswoman for the Armenian prime minister, said “100,490 forcefully displaced persons arrived in Armenia” by Sunday morning. Yerevan has accused Baku of “ethnic cleansing” – an allegation Baku has rejected.  Armenia, a country of 2.8 million, faces a major challenge housing the sudden influx of refugees. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies on Friday announced an emergency appeal for 20 million Swiss francs ($22m) to help those fleeing. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan is holding “reintegration” talks with separatist leaders while also detaining senior figures from its former government and military command. Azerbaijan’s Prosecutor General Kamran Aliyev said criminal investigations had been initiated into war crimes committed by 300 separatist officials. “I urge on those persons to surrender voluntarily,” he told journalists on Sunday. Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev and Armenia’s Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan are set to meet on Thursday in the Spanish city of Granada for Western-mediated talks aimed at ending their historic enmity. With the two countries’ relations poisoned by ethnic hatred ensuing from three wars in as many decades, several rounds of negotiations mediated by Brussels and Washington have so far failed to bring about a breakthrough."
How will a pro-Rus­sia par­ty win­ning Slo­va­kia vote af­fect the Ukraine war?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/1/how-will-a-pro-russia-party-winning-slovakia-vote-affect-the-ukraine-war,Ex-PM Robert Fico is set to re­place a tech­no­crat gov­ern­ment that has been back­ing Kyiv against the Russ­ian in­va­sion.,"The leftist-populist party of former Prime Minister Robert Fico has won theparliamentary electionsin Slovakia, running on a campaign with two clear messages: no more military support to Ukraine and no more sanctions against Russia. Fico’s Smer-SD party scored nearly 23 percent of the vote, earning the president’s nod on Sunday to start talks to replace a technocrat government that has been backing Kyiv against Russia’s invasion. The parties likely to join the new coalition are the left-wing Hlas (Voice) party – which won 14.7 percent of the votes – and the ultranationalist Slovak National Party, a clear pro-Russian group, that received 5.6 percent. A liberal, pro-West newcomer, the Progressive Slovakia party was a distant second with 18 percent of the votes. Its leader Michal Simecka, who is the deputy president of the European Parliament, said his party respected the result. “But it’s bad news for Slovakia,” he said. “And it would be even worse if Robert Fico manages to create a government.” Slovakia is a member of the NATO military alliance, which is backing Ukraine against Russian President Vladimir Putin, but many of its people are sympathetic to Moscow’s line that the West wants to annihilate it. Fico, 59, said Slovakia has bigger problems than the Ukraine issue, including energy prices and living costs, but his party would do everything possible to start peace talks. During his campaign, Ficopledged to stopsupporting neighbouring Ukraine in its war against Russia. “We are not changing that we are prepared to help Ukraine in a humanitarian way,” said Fico, whom analysts consider to be inspired by Hungary’s nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban who has frequently clashed with the EU. “We are prepared to help with the reconstruction of the state but you know our opinion on arming Ukraine,” he added at a news conference. In the past, Fico had opposed Ukraine’s bid to join NATO, saying it would “mean the beginning of World War III”. “The war in Ukraine didn’t start a year ago, it started in 2014 when Ukrainian Nazis and fascists started murdering Russian citizens in the Donbas and Luhansk,” he had said in August. “We need to tell the whole world: Freedom came from the East, war always comes from the West.” So far, Slovakia – a country 5.5 million people created in 1993 following the breakup of Czechoslovakia – was a staunch supporter of Ukraine. Since the start of the war in February last year, Bratislava opened its borders to the fleeing refugees and was a key logistical hub in NATO’s effort to transport military support to Ukraine. Slovakia – ranked among the top five European donors to Kyiv in terms of its gross domestic product – donated more than half its MiG fighter jets and dozens of infantry vehicles. It was the first EU country to support Kyiv with an antiaircraft missile system, the S-300. “This [military support] comes to an end with the result of the elections,” said Wojciech Przybylski, political analyst and head of Visegrad Insight think tank. “And there will be questions from Ukraine and its Western allies on how much intelligence can be shared with Slovakia without the risk of leaks and of jeopardising transportation routes,” Przybylski said. Such change in Slovakia’s policy, Przybylski added, will have a political impact by breaching what has been so far a united front among European countries in supporting Kyiv.  Fico’s critics worry his return to power could lead Slovakia to abandon course in other ways as well,mostly on the linesof Hungary’s Orban, who has also been an outlier on Ukraine and often spars with the EU over the war. Orban congratulated Fico on Sunday with a post on X social media platform saying: “Guess who’s back!” “Always good to work together with a patriot,” he added. Hungary also has – uniquely among EU countries – maintained close relations with Moscow and argued against supplying arms to Ukraine or providing it with economic aid. Fico, who campaigned strongly against immigration in the run-up to Saturday’s election and criticised a caretaker government for not doing more, said re-starting border controls with Hungary would represent a top priority. “One of the first decisions of the government must be an order renewing border controls with Hungary,” Fico told a news conference. “It will not be a pretty picture,” he said, adding force would be needed on the 655km (407 miles) border. Przybylski said Fico will likely push anti-immigration policies in order to appeal to the working class who perceive migrants as a workforce competition."
At least 13 dead in night­club fire in Spain’s Mur­cia,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/1/at-least-13-dead-in-nightclub-fire-in-spains-murcia,Res­cuers search­ing for peo­ple un­ac­count­ed for af­ter blaze hits row of night­clubs pop­u­lar for birth­day cel­e­bra­tions.,"At least 13 people have been killed in a fire in a Spanish nightclub, authorities say, with fears the toll could still rise as rescue workers sift through the debris. The fire ripped through adjoining nightclubs in Murcia in southeast Spain on Sunday, emergency services said, adding that rescuers were still searching for people unaccounted for after the blaze. Emergency services posted on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, that firefighters were continuing to work at the scene and had not ruled out “the possibility of finding more victims”. Jose Ballesta, mayor of Murcia, said the fire had broken out at around 6am local time (04:00 GMT) and was “extremely serious”. Ballesta told reporters at the scene “there are still bodies to be pulled out” from the rubble, which he said was a complicated task given the “risk of collapse”. Diego Seral, of Spain’s National Police, told reporters the dead were found in the Fonda nightclub, one of three adjoining clubs, which had sustained the majority of fire damage, including the collapse of its roof. The collapse was making it hard to locate victims, and it was also difficult to pinpoint yet where exactly the fire started, he said. The identification of the bodies would take time, Seral noted. The cause of the blaze is being investigated. Outside the club, young people hugged, looking shocked as they waited for information. “I think we left 30 seconds to one minute before the alarms went off and all the lights went out [and] the screams saying there was a fire,” said a survivor, who was not identified. “Five family members and two friends are missing.” Photos released by the emergency services show water hoses from fire trucks spraying the blackened facade of the club. Thick smoke could be seen billowing from the roof of the building. Authorities said four people were injured: two women aged 22 and 25, and two men in their 40s, all suffering from smoke inhalation. A spokesperson for the Teatre nightclub, Maria Dolores Albellan, told reporters the fire originated in the neighbouring club, Fonda, before spreading to the two adjoining clubs. Spanish media reported several birthday celebrations were taking place at the time. Ballesta declared three days of mourning in the city to remember those who died. Flags were lowered to half-mast outside Murcia’s City Hall. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez voiced “solidarity with the victims and relatives of the tragic fire in a Murcia nightclub”. Forty people were injured in 2017 in a packed nightclub on Spain’s holiday island of Tenerife when a floor collapsed. In 1990, 43 people died in a fire at a nightclub in Spain’s northeastern city of Zaragoza."
Afghanistan clos­es em­bassy in In­dia cit­ing lack of diplo­mat­ic sup­port,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/1/afghanistan-embassy-closes-in-india-citing-lack-of-diplomatic-support,"The move comes due to lack of sup­port from In­dia and in­creas­ing­ly chal­leng­ing con­di­tions to op­er­ate, the em­bassy says.","The embassy of Afghanistan in India, which owed its allegiance to the former West-backed government, has announced its closure, saying it would cease operations starting from October 1. The Afghan embassy’s statement on Saturday said it wanted to reach an agreement with the Indian government to ensure that the interests of Afghans living, working, studying and doing business in India are safeguarded. Afghans account for around one-third of the nearly 40,000 refugees registered in India, according to the United Nations’ refugee agency. But that figure excludes those who are not registered with the UN. “There has been a significant reduction in both personnel and resources available to us, making it increasingly challenging to continue operations,” the statement said. The closure comes more than two years after the Taliban government stormed back to power triggering the collapse of the government of President Ashraf Ghani in the wake of the US withdrawing its troops after 20 years of war and occupation. “It is with profound sadness, regret, and disappointment that the Embassy of Afghanistan in New Delhi announces this decision to cease its operations,” the embassy said. The decision was taken due to lack of “crucial support” from India which has hampered the embassy’s capacity to carry out the embassy’s duties, read the statement. There were also shortcomings in meeting the expectations to best serve Afghani citizens due to “the absence of a legitimate functioning government in Kabul”, read the statement, referring to the Taliban administration. The closure follows reports that the ambassador and other senior diplomats had left India in recent months, with infighting among those remaining in New Delhi. But the embassy rejected speculations regarding internal infighting among its staff, stressing that these were “unfounded” rumours. India will take control of the embassy in a caretaker capacity, it said. At the time of publication, India’s foreign ministry did not issue any statement in response to the announcement.  No country officially recognises Afghanistan’s new government, but acknowledge the Taliban as the de facto ruling authority. This has left many Afghan embassies and consulates in limbo, with diplomats appointed by the former government refusing to cede control of embassy buildings and property to representatives chosen by the Taliban authorities. India has not recognised the Taliban government, which seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021. It evacuated its own staff from Kabul ahead of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan two years ago and no longer has a diplomatic presence there. Yet, New Delhi iskeen to retain tieswith the country where its regional rival Pakistan wields considerable influence. Indian envoys havepreviously metTaliban representatives in Doha, the capital of Qatar, where the group has an office. Last year, India sent relief materials, including wheat, medicine, COVID-19 vaccines and winter clothes to Afghanistan to help with shortages there. In June last year, India sent a team of officials to its embassy in Kabul. Before the Taliban took control, India provided Afghan security forces with training and military equipment but had no troops on the ground. It was also the region’s largest provider of development aid to Afghanistan."

"Un­leash bowlers, scrap um­pire’s call: Rules crick­et needs to change",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2023/10/1/five-rules-cricket-needs-to-change,"Free hits, um­pire’s calls and over lim­its are among five rules Al Jazeera thinks should be done away with in crick­et.","Twelve months ago, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), guardians of the laws of cricket, brought new laws into the sport while tweaking some existing ones. From replacement players and dead balls to banning non-striker runouts and the application of saliva on the ball, cricket underwent significant changes. But there’s always room for more. Here are five more rules that Al Jazeera thinks cricket needs to change. Cricket is a batters’ game, regardless of what format it is being played in or the status of the match in question. The crowd’s love for boundaries, high scores and seeing the ball in the stands has often been touted as the reason behind authorities tilting it in the favour of batters. A batter often gets away with mistakes – a dropped catch, an edge dropping short, hit-and-miss. However, there are penalties aplenty for a bowler, including when they overstep, resulting in not only an extra run and the batter not being given out but also a free hit that follows. If a batter is allowed to get away with an error, there is no need for an extra penalty for the bowler after a little stretch of the foot. We’ve established it’s a batters’ game; from limiting the number of bouncers in an over and the number of new balls from both ends in ODIs, to imposing fielding restrictions and over limits for bowlers. So why is a batter allowed a second chance to stop the ball from hitting the stumps after there has been an attempt to play it and it comes off the bat or ricochets off the body towards the stumps? Since a batter is penalised for obstructing or impeding a throw, why is a likely wicket-taking opportunity denied in this way? The fact that the ball is stumps-bound means the bowler has clearly done something right. Lay down the Eminem rule: You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow … Let’s talk about over limits in detail. Why do we have them? Batters, if they’re good enough, can go on for 20 or 50 overs (depending on the format) to show their worth and stack up records. Bowlers can’t. While watching Rohit Sharma or Ben Stokes make it rain sixes for the majority of the innings is immensely rewarding for cricket lovers, the same opportunities should be offered to Rashid Khan’s wizardry or Shaheen Shah Afridi’s curlers. If the batters aren’t forced to return to the dressing room, why are the bowlers confined to the boundary when they could conjure up as much magic and excitement as the batters? An aerial shot heads for the crowd. The fielder times a jump perfectly, pushing the ball in the air and back into the direction it came from. They jump back into the field of play to complete a catch or throw it back to teammates if a catch is not possible – either way, a four or six has been prevented. The agility, presence of mind and athleticism are commendable, but that should have been a boundary. The batter should not be penalised for the ball not touching the ground (or the advertising boards) after crossing the boundary. Cricket should follow football’s example, where a goal is given when the whole ball crosses the line. A review is taken and all eyes are on the big screen. Ball tracking shows the ball hitting the stumps. But is it out or not out? Well, that depends on what the on-field umpire said in the first place; the umpire’s original judgement can overrule the judgement of the technology, for example, a “not out” in a situation in which the ball is shown clipping the stumps in an LBW. Former head of the ICC Cricket Committee, Anil Kumble, has said that it’s “important” the umpire’s call remains part of the review system. “The principle underpinning DRS [Decision Review System] was to correct clear errors in the game whilst ensuring the role of the umpire as the decision-maker on the field of play was preserved, bearing in mind the element of prediction involved with the technology,” Kumble said. “Umpire’s call allows that to happen, which is why it is important it remains.” But the soft signal – whereby on-field umpires indicated an unofficial verdict on a potential wicket while sending a review to the TV wicket – has been taken out of the game. So the umpire’s call can easily follow suit."
US gov­ern­ment shut­down avert­ed. What hap­pens next?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/1/us-government-shutdown-averted-what-happens-next,"Con­gress has passed a stop­gap mea­sure, but will law­mak­ers agree on de­tailed spend­ing bills for the en­tire fis­cal year?","The US Congress has passed a stopgap funding bill, averting for now a looming government shutdown that would have disrupted many services, squeezed federal employees and roiled politics. The House of Representativesvoted335-91 late on Saturday to fund the government temporarily, with 209 Democrats supporting the measure compared with 126 Republicans in a show of rare unity that ended the stalemate. If no funding legislation was enacted, federal agencies would have stopped all non-essential work and would not send paychecks as long as the shutdown would last. US President Joe Biden signed the bill after it was cleared by the Democratic-controlled Senate. The Republicans narrowly control the US House of Representatives. Here are the main things you should know about what is ahead: The fact that the bill will only liquidate the government for a further 45 days means that renewed intense discussions lie ahead in the two bodies of Congress, the Senate, and the House of Representatives, to avert another potential shutdown. Therefore, if an agreement cannot be reached by November 17, millions of federal workers will, once again, face delayed paychecks, including many of the roughly two million military personnel and more than two million civilian workers across the nation. Before the last-minute deal, federal agencies had already drawn up detailed plans that spell out what services would continue, such as airport screening and border patrols, and what must shut down, including scientific research and nutrition aid to seven million poor mothers. US Congress has blocked new aid for Ukraine in the government spending deal despite calls from the White House and efforts by Democratic members of the Congress. Biden has and will be been pressing Congress in the days ahead to provide an additional $24bn for Ukraine and other international needs amid Russia’s ongoing invasion. According to the US media, the Senate had proposed a bipartisan bill to send about $6bn to Kyiv, but Democrats cautious of being accused of a government shutdown passed the House version of the bill with no aid. “We cannot under any circumstances allow American support for Ukraine to be interrupted,” Biden said in a statement after the bill was passed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked for more aid from the US in a visit in late September when he met with Biden as well as top military officials and addressed Congress. The Biden administration has given more than $75bn in assistance to Ukraine since the war began in February 2022. The shutdown crisis was largely triggered by a small group of hardline Republicans who had defied their own party leadership to scupper various temporary funding proposals as they pressed for deep spending cuts. The group of 21 hardliners had threatened to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker if a stopgap measure they opposed was passed with Democrat support, and many Washington watchers were expecting the speaker to have to fight for his job in the coming weeks. McCarthy sought to convey confidence both about his own future and the prospects for securing a final agreement by the new mid-November deadline. “In 45 days, we should get our work all done,” he said while seeming to offer a hand to the hardliners, saying, “I welcome those 21 back in.” The government shutdown standoffcomesjust months after Congress brought the federal government to the brink of defaulting on its $31.4 trillion debt. The drama has raised worries on Wall Street, where the rating agency Moody’s has warned it could damage US creditworthiness. Moody’s has an “Aaa” rating for the US government with a stable outlook – the highest creditworthiness it assigns to borrowers. It is the last major agency with such a rating after Fitch downgraded the US government Aaa rating by one notch in August to AA+ – the same rating assigned by S&P Global in 2011."
In­ter­na­tion­al Cof­fee Day: Where does your caf­feine fix come from?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/1/international-coffee-day-where-does-your-caffeine-fix-come-from,"Brazil is the world’s largest pro­duc­er of cof­fee, pro­duc­ing about one-third of glob­al sup­ply.","Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world with an estimated two billion cups consumed each day. To recognise the work of millions of coffee farmers, producers and baristas from all over the world, every year on October 1, the world celebratesInternational Coffee Day. This year’s theme is “promoting the right to a safe and healthy working environment in the coffee supply chain”. In this infographic series, Al Jazeera visually presents the coffee production process, outlines the various types of coffee and showcases the top coffee-producing nations around the world. Coffee consumption is thought to have its origins dating back as far as the ninth century in the region that is now Ethiopia in East Africa, where wild coffee plants grew naturally. The invigorating drink then spread to other regions across the Arabian Peninsula, such as Yemen and by the 15th century, coffee cultivation and preparation methods had developed to become an integral part of the culture. Coffee trade expanded across the Middle East and made its way to Europe by the 17th century through trade routes across Italy. Although they may resemble beans, “coffee beans” are actually the seeds of the coffee fruit which are found in pairs inside a red coffee cherry. It takes about three to four years for a coffee plant to bear its first harvest. The infographic below breaks down the coffee production process: There are two main types of coffee beans used in commercial coffee production – Arabica and Robusta. Arabicais the most widely consumed form of coffee beans accounting for between 60 to 70 percent of global coffee production. Arabica is known for its fine, mild aromatic properties and is generally considered a higher-quality coffee bean compared to Robusta coffee. Robustais known for its bold, strong and often bitter taste. Robusta beans have a higher caffeine content compared to Arabica and are usually cheaper to cultivate. Robusta is named after its robust properties and resistance to spoilage which makes it ideal for use in instant coffees. In 2020, the world produced about 10.7 million metric tonnes of coffee beansaccordingto the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organization. Brazil is the world’s largest producer of coffee, producing about one-third (3.7 million tonnes) of global production. The South American country’s vast and diverse landscape provides an ideal environment for coffee cultivation allowing it to grow both Arabica and Robusta coffee varieties. Vietnam, with 1.8 million tonnes, is the world’s second-largest coffee producer followed by Colombia (830,000 tonnes), Indonesia (770,000 tonnes) and Ethiopia (580,000 tonnes). Combined, these five countries account for nearly 75 percent of the world’s coffee production. The animation below shows the top coffee-producing countries in 2000-2020. "
"Who is Mo­hamed Muiz­zu, Mal­dives’s pro-Chi­na pres­i­dent-elect?",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/1/who-is-mohamed-muizzu-maldivess-pro-china-president-elect,"The op­po­si­tion can­di­date beats the in­cum­bent, Pres­i­dent Ibrahim Mo­hamed Solih, who is con­sid­ered pro-In­dia.","Voters in the Indian Ocean archipelago of Maldives on Saturdayelectedopposition leader Mohamed Muizzu as the country’s president, giving him 54 percent of the votes, according to preliminary results. Muizzu, candidate for the Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM), roundly defeated incumbent President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih of the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) and is set to be sworn in on November 17. The president-elect is widely seen as sympathetic to China’s interests in the country, and less favourably disposed towards India, Maldives’s giant neighbour and traditional security and economic partner. Solih, who is viewed aspro-India, accepted the results. “Congratulations to president-elect Muizzu,” Solih wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “I also congratulate the people who have shown a peaceful and democratic process.” The result upends Solih’s efforts to revert the country’s diplomatic posture back towards New Delhi since taking office five years ago. A British-educated civil engineer, Muizzu, 45, is the current mayor of Male, the country’s capital. He was an unlikely candidate for the presidency after serving as construction minister in the government of his mentor Abdulla Yameen. But Yameen’s jailing on corruption charges — which his party says were politically motivated — saw Muizzu tapped to lead the party as his proxy in an election where the strategically placed country’s ties with China and India were on the ballot. As minister under Yameen, Muizzu oversaw several Chinese-funded infrastructure projects in the country of less than one million people, including a $200m bridge linking the capital with the archipelago’s main airport. He told Chinese Communist Party officials during an online meeting last year that his party’s return to office would expand the “strong ties between our two countries”. Al Jazeera’s Tony Cheng, reporting from Male, said Muizzu might find it hard to fulfil all the promises he made during campaigning. “India is deeply involved enmeshed in the finances, in trade, in infrastructure growth. I think it will be very hard, even if he wanted to, to stop that. He has publicly said he favours China,” Cheng said. “China has been very deeply involved in financing a lot of infrastructure growth. But there are problems there too in that Maldives has a very considerable debt owed to China, some of which are due in a couple of years,” he added.  Muizzu’s election success hinged on a sustained campaign against India’s outsized political and economic clout in the Maldives. New Delhi has a history of entanglements with affairs in Maldives, including the deployment of soldiers to thwart a 1988 coup attempt. Its influence has been a periodic source of resentment in the Muslim-majority nation. The Maldives sits in a strategically vital position in the middle of the Indian Ocean, astride one of the world’s busiest east-west shipping lanes. Solih was elected in 2018 on the back of discontent with Yameen’s increasingly controversial rule — many political opponents were locked up in the same prison where the former president is now behind bars — accusing him of pushing the country into a Chinese debt trap. Yameen’s turn towards Beijing had also alarmed New Delhi, which shares concerns with the United States and its allies about China’s growing assertiveness in the Indian Ocean. India is a member of the strategic Quad alliance alongside the US, Australia and Japan."

At­tack­ers car­ry out blast in the heart of Turk­ish cap­i­tal,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/1/explosion-and-gunfire-reported-in-turkish-capital,In­te­ri­or Min­is­ter Ali Yer­likaya says one of the two at­tack­ers blew him­self up in front of min­istry build­ing in Ankara.,"A suicide bomber has detonated an explosive device in front of the ministry building in the Turkish capital Ankara, wounding two police officers, according to the country’s interior minister. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday that the “terrorists” will never achieve their aims, a few hours after an attack near the country’s parliament in Ankara. “The villains who threaten the peace and security of citizens have not achieved their objectives and will never achieve them,” he said as the parliament opened after summer recess. Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said two attackers were responsible for the explosions in front of the Ministry of Interior building. One of them blew himself and the other was “neutralised”, the minister said. The blast was followed by gunfire outside the Ministry of Interior and parliament buildings. There have also been reports of a rocket being launched. Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbul, said the explosion took place at about 9:30am (06:30 GMT).  “The security has been tightened around the parliament building and around the Interior Ministry building that are in close proximity.” She said the attack came hours before the parliament was set to resume after its summer break. Koseoglu said it was too early to say who might be behind the attack. The attack comes as Turkish authorities have been carrying out operations against ISIL (ISIS) members. This is the first attack since October 2015, when an ISIL assault in front of a central station in Ankara killed 109 people. Authorities said Saturday that multiple suspicious packages and bags were found around the area of the attack and are being detonated by experts in a controlled manner, which has resulted in two loud blasts being heard in the area. Al Jazeera correspondent Resul Serdar pointed out that CCTV footage of the attack shows how the street was empty when the attack occurred, whereas it may have been full of pedestrians at another time. “You can see that their motivation is to directly target the Ministry of Interior rather than harming civilians,” he said. Serdar said this was a planned and “sophisticated” attack because the vehicle that was used by the attackers was registered in the neighbouring city of Kayseri, with some reports suggesting the perpetrators murdered a person there and took their car. Ahmet Keser, a retired Turkish army colonel and head of Political Science and International Relations at Hasan Kayloncu University, said this was “a very well-organised terrorist incident”. He told Al Jazeera that the attackers planned the time to coincide with a ceremony at the parliament to mark the opening of the new parliamentary year. “This might be a kind of incident to try to affect the decision of the parliamentarians as well,” Kayloncu said, in reference to an expected vote on Sweden’s accession to NATO. A judicial investigation has been launched into the attack, according to Turkish Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc. “These attacks will in no way hinder Turkey’s fight against terrorism. Our fight against terrorism will continue even more decisively. Let no one have any doubt about this,” Tunc said in a post on social media platform X, which is formerly known as Twitter. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, Turkey’s main opposition leader, condemned the “terrorist attack” and vowed that Turkey would be united in fighting any such assaults from any source. "
‘Bug­ger!’: New Zealand PM gets COVID at crit­i­cal point in elec­tion cam­paign,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/1/bugger-new-zealand-pm-gets-covid-at-critical-point-in-election-campaign,Chris Hip­kins says he will iso­late and try to con­tin­ue cam­paign on­line af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for the virus on Sun­day.,"New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins has tested positive for COVID-19 as the general election campaign enters its final two weeks. Hipkins, who took over the leadership of the ruling Labour Party fromJacinda Ardernin January, has been struggling to connect with voters in his campaign for re-election. On Sunday, he took to Facebook to announce he had got the coronavirus after developing cold and flu symptoms on Saturday. He said he would take his campaign online instead. “Bugger! After a rough night I woke up this morning feeling pretty unwell and just got this test result,” he said in the post on his official page, sharing a photograph of his rapid antigen test. “I’m in close contact with New Zealanders on the campaign trail and I don’t want to pass it on to anyone, so I’ll be following the guidance and isolating for a few days or until I get a negative test.” Hipkinssaid he would try to continue with as many of his campaign events online as he could. “There’s a lot at stake this election, and I’ll be working doubly hard when I can get back out there to make sure Labour is re-elected,” he added. Opinion polls show Labour’s support lagging with the centre-right National Party of former businessman Christopher Luxon on track to form a coalition government with smaller parties. Hipkins’s COVID-19 test came as his party launched its manifesto showcasing policies, including maths and literacy catch-up courses for schoolchildren who lost study hours because of coronavirus disruption, free dental care for those below 30, more front-line police and four weeks paid parental leave for partners. New Zealand removed its last COVID-19 restrictions in August, but health authorities still recommend that people stay home for five days if unwell, or if they have tested positive. That means Hipkins is also likely to miss his next debate with Luxon, which is scheduled for Tuesday night."
Pro-Rus­sia par­ty wins Slo­va­kia’s par­lia­men­tary elec­tions,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/1/pro-russia-party-claims-victory-in-slovakia-election,Left-wing for­mer Prime Min­is­ter Robert Fico has promised to end mil­i­tary aid for Ukraine.,"The populist partyof former Prime Minister Robert Fico that wants to stop military aid to Ukraine and is critical of the European Union and NATO has won Slovakia’s election, results showed on Sunday. SMER-SSD party scored 23.3 percent, beating the centrist Progressive Slovakia (PS) that garnered 17 percent of the votes, the Slovak Statistics Office said early on Sunday after completing the count of 99.98 percent of the votes from some 6,000 polling stations. Saturday’s vote was a test for the small Eastern European country’s support for neighbouring Ukraine in its war with Russia. The 59-year-old Fico has promised that Slovakia, one of Europe’s biggest donors to Ukraine as a share of its gross domestic product (GDP), will not send “a single round of ammunition” to Ukraine and has called for better relations with Russia. The country of 5.5 million people created in 1993 following the breakup of Czechoslovakia has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since Russia invaded last February, donating arms and opening the borders for refugees fleeing the war. With no party winning an outright majority, the party with the largest share of the vote gets the first chance to form a coalition and the composition of any government is likely to be dependent on half a dozen smaller parties. Fico, who served as prime minister from 2006 to 2010 and again from 2012 to 2018, is likely to become prime minister if he is able to get the support of the left-wing Hlas (Voice) party, which came in third with 14.7 percent votes. Another potential coalition partner, the ultranationalist Slovak National Party, a clear pro-Russian group, received 5.6 percent. The leader of the Hlas party, Peter Pellegrini, congratulated Fico on his victory but said two former prime ministers in one government might not work well. “It’s not ideal but that doesn’t mean such a coalition can’t be created,” Pellegrini, Fico’s former deputy in SMER-SSD, said. The three parties would have a parliamentary majority if they joined forces in a coalition government. PS leader Michal Simecka said on Sunday that the party would do what it could to prevent vote winner SMER-SSD from forming a government. “SMER-SSD won the election, we of course respect that,” Simecka told a news conference. “But at the same time, we believe that this is very bad news for Slovakia. And it would be even worse news if Robert Fico succeeds in forming a government,” he added. Analysts predict a Fico government could radically change Slovakia’s foreign policy toresemble that of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, straining a fragile unity in the EU and NATO on opposing Russia’sfull-scale invasionin February 2022. Fico’s views reflect traditionally warm sentiments towards Russia among many Slovaks."
Ukraine tempts West­ern arms pro­duc­ers with plan for ‘large mil­i­tary hub’,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/1/ukraine-tempts-western-arms-producers-with-plan-for-large-military-hub,In­cen­tives avail­able to part­ner with Ukrain­ian man­u­fac­tur­ers as Kyiv looks to cre­ate ‘world class mil­i­tary prod­ucts’.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced plans to expand the country’s domestic defence industry through partnerships with Western weapons manufacturers, in a bid to increase supplies for its counteroffensive against Russia. Speaking at the opening of the International Defence Industries Forum, Zelenskyy said he wanted to make Ukraine’s defence sector into a “large military hub” where military equipment and weapons could be built and repaired. “Ukraine is in such a phase of the defence marathon when it is very important, critical to go forward without retreating. Results from the front line are needed daily,” the president told executives representing more than 250 Western weapons producers. “We are interested in localising production of equipment needed for our defence and each of those advanced defence systems which are used by our soldiers, giving Ukraine the best results at the front today.” Zelenskyy said that air defence and de-mining were his immediate priorities. Ukraine also aims to boost domestic production of missiles, drones and artillery ammunition. The foreign ministry said Ukrainian producers had signed about 20 agreements with foreign partners for joint production, exchange of technology or supply of components to make drones, armoured vehicles and ammunition. It did not identify the companies. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who spoke by video link during the forum after visiting Kyiv earlier in the week, threw his weight behind the initiative. “Heroism alone cannot intercept missiles. Ukraine needs capabilities, high quality, high quantity, and quickly,” Stoltenberg said. “There is no defence without industry.” Ukraine retook the southern city ofKhersonin November last year, and began a long-awaitedcounteroffensivein early June to try and recapture other territories seized by Russia, which launched itsfull-scale invasionof the country in February 2022. Kyiv has reported advances in several directions and liberated more than a dozen villages since but Moscow still controls about 18 percent of Ukrainian territory. Ukraine’s allies have provided financial and military support worth tens of billions of dollars to help it push back Moscow’s forces. Ukrainian officials see the development of the country’s domestic defence industry as a potential boost to the economy, which shrunk by about a third last year as a result of the war. Several leading Western arms makers including Germany’s Rheinmetall and the United Kingdom’s BAE Systems have already announced plans to team up with Ukrainian producers. Ukraine will create new incentives to draw Western defence investment and establish a special fund, through dividends from state defence resources and profits from the sale of confiscated Russian assets, to support new technology development, officials said. “It will be a mutually beneficial partnership. I think it is a good time and place to create a large military hub,” Zelenskyy said during a separate meeting with weapons producers from the United States, the UK, Czechia, Germany, France, Sweden and Turkey. Recently appointed Defence MinisterRustem Umerovsaid Kyiv had to do everything possible to produce all the necessary military services andproductsin Ukraine for the needs of its army. “Our vision is to develop world-class military products,” Umerov said."

Mo­hamed Muiz­zu wins Mal­dives elec­tion in vic­to­ry for pro-Chi­na camp,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/30/maldives-opposition-candidate-muiz-wins-presidential-runoff,In­cum­bent Ibrahim Mo­hamed Solih con­cedes de­feat short­ly be­fore mid­night af­ter Muiz­zu wins 54 per­cent of the vote.,"Mohamed Muizzu has won the presidential election in the Maldives after a second-round run-off against incumbent Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, which was seen as a test of the Indian Ocean archipelago’s nascent democracy as well as its ties withChina and traditional benefactor India. Muizzu, 45, leads a party that welcomed an influx of Chinese loans and oversaw a wide-ranging crackdown on dissent when it was last in power. Incumbent Ibrahim Mohamed Solih conceded defeat shortly before midnight after the Elections Commission of the Maldives said Muizzu had won 54.06 percent of the vote in the run-off contest. “Congratulations to president-elect Muizzu,” Solih wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Thank you for the beautiful democratic example shown by the people in the elections,” he added. Solih, 61, will remain as caretaker president until his successor’s inauguration on November 17. Muizzu, 45, emerged as thesurprise frontrunnerduring the first round of voting on September 8, taking some 46 percent of the ballots cast. Solih – hurt by a low voter turnout and a split within his Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) – won 39 percent. The run-off was seen as having significant implications for the Maldives’s foreign policy, especially in decidingChina and India’s battlefor influence in the strategically-located country. “Today’s result is a reflection of the patriotism of our people. A call on all our neighbours and bilateral partners to fully respect our independence and sovereignty,” Mohamed Shareef, a top official from Muizzu’s Progressive Party of Maldives, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency. Muizzu, who is currently the mayor of the capital Male, made a brief appearance outside his party’s campaign headquarters to urge supporters not to celebrate until Sunday morning, when campaign restrictions officially come to an end. Muizzu, a one-time housing minister, played a pivotal role in an earlier government’s development programme, bankrolled in part by financial largesse from China’s Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. He told a meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials last year that his party’s return to office would “script a further chapter of strong ties between our two countries”. The party’s return to power might also mean freedom for former President Abdulla Yameen, Muizzu’s mentor. Yameen, who lost power in 2018 as he moved the country closer to China and became increasingly autocratic, is serving an 11-year prison term for corruption and money laundering. His supporters say the charges against him are politically motivated. Watchdog group Transparency Maldives said there had been some incidents of “electoral violence,” without specifying further details. There were more than 282,000 eligible voters and turnout was 85 percent, slightly higher than the first-round vote. Solih, who was first elected president in 2018, was battling allegations by Muizzu that he had allowed India an unchecked presence in the country. Solih has insisted that the Indian military’s presence in the Maldives was only to build a dockyard under an agreement between the two governments and that his country’s sovereignty will not be violated. Muizzu promised that if he won the presidency, he would remove Indian troops from the Maldives and balance the country’s trade relations, which he claimed were heavily in India’s favour. Ahmed Shaheed, a former foreign minister of the Maldives, described the outcome as a verdict on the government’s failure to meet economic and governance expectations rather than concerns over Indian influence. “I don’t think India was at all in the people’s minds,” Saheed said. Solih suffered a setback closer to the election when Mohamed Nasheed, a charismatic former president, broke away from his Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) and fielded his own candidate in the first round. He decided to remain neutral in the second round. “Nasheed’s departure took the motherboard away from the MDP,” Shaheed said. Yameen, leader of the Progressive Party of the Maldives, made the Maldives a part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative during his presidency from 2013 to 2018. The initiative is meant to build railroads, ports and highways to expand trade – and China’s influence – across Asia, Africa and Europe. Nevertheless, Muizzu is unlikely to change the foreign policy of affording an important place to India. Rather, opposition to Chinese projects is likely to lessen, evening power balances out, Shaheed said. "
Res­cue group de­cries Libya coast­guard ram­ming into mi­grant boat,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/30/rescue-group-decries-libya-coast-guard-ramming-into-dinghy,Video from Sea-Watch In­ter­na­tion­al shows Libyan coast­guards crash­ing into a dinghy with dozens of mi­grants on board.,"Rescue group Sea-Watch International has condemned the European Union’smigration policyafter posting a video showing a migrant and refugee boat in the Mediterranean coming under attack by the Libyan coastguard. The video, recorded on board Sea-Watch’s twin-engine Seabird, shows most of those on the vessel fall into the water and are seen swimming desperately to a nearby Libyan ship for safety. Dozens or so were reportedly on the dinghy when it was hit, Sea-Watch said. “What we have seen yesterday … is the brutal and daily disgusting migration policy of the European Union,” Felix Weiss of Sea-Watch told Al Jazeera. “This is something that we see day by day. It’s the reality of European migration policy, which is empowering these coastguards to make sure that less people are reaching European shores,” he added. Shortly after the boat is hit, a larger patrol boat is seen throwing life vests to people in the water.  The Germany-based organisation said the coastguard took the 50 or so migrants and refugees back to Libya, calling the incident an “attempted murder” on their account on X, formerly known as Twitter. Sea-Watch said it was not clear if there were any casualties. The group added that despite the group’s several warnings, the coastguard still went ahead and crashed into the dinghy and destroyed it. Starting in 2015, the EU has provided financial support to the Libyan coastguard as part of its plan to reduce the migration of people from North Africa. Humanitarian organisations and rescue groups have reported that Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s far-right administration has imposed more stringent restrictions on the operations of humanitarian vessels. In August, Italian authorities apprehended the Sea Eye 4, a vessel based in Germany, following its rescue and then transportation of individuals to the southern Italian port city of Salerno. Rescue groups assert the government frequently redirects their ships to northern ports after just one rescue mission, a practice they believe hampers their capacity to save people at sea. According to the International Organization for Migration, more than 1,800 individuals have been documented as either missing or deceased on the Central Mediterranean route in 2023. This route alone constitutes more than three-quarters of the total casualties in the Mediterranean region over the past decade. Last month, the Greek coastguardrescued 18 peopleand saved four individuals from a boat that had capsized near Lesbos island’s coastline. In June, an overcrowded fishing trawler, carrying some 500 people from Libya to Italy,sankabout 80km (50 miles) from the southern Greek coastal town of Pylos. Only 104 survivors were found. "
US Con­gress pass­es stop­gap mea­sure to avert gov­ern­ment shut­down,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/30/us-house-passes-stopgap-measure-to-avert-government-shutdown,"Mea­sure will see US gov­ern­ment fund­ed un­til mid-No­vem­ber, but Ukrain­ian aid dropped as hard right Re­pub­li­cans dig in.","The United States’ Congress has passed a temporary funding bill to keep the federal government running until mid-November and avert a costly government shutdown by leaving out aid to war-torn Ukraine requested by President Joe Biden. The House of Representatives voted 335-91 late on Saturday to fund the government for a further 45 days, with 209 Democrats supporting the measure compared with 126 Republicans. The Democratic-majority Senate then voted 88-9 in favour of the measure just three hours before the midnight Saturday deadline to avoid what would have been the federal government’s fourth partialshutdownin a decade. The move marked a profound shift from earlier in the week when a shutdown, which would have forced the closure of a range of public services and that leave most of the government’s 4 million employees unpaid, looked all but inevitable. The vote will ensure the government is funded until November 17, and also increases federal disaster assistance by $16 billion. “Tonight, bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate voted to keep the government open, preventing an unnecessary crisis that would have inflicted needless pain on millions of hardworking Americans,” Biden said in a statement. But he berated House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and the House Republicans for reneging on spending levels agreed with the White House months ago — a major reason for the shutdown near-miss — and for stripping out support for Ukraine. “I fully expect the speaker will keep his commitment to the people of Ukraine and secure passage of the support needed to help Ukraine at this critical moment,” said the president, who is set to sign the measure into law before the 12.01am local time (04:01 GMT) deadline. The stopgap measure stripping out Ukraine aid was pitched by McCarthy just hours ahead of the deadline, but but the reprieve may be short lived. Congress will again need to fund the government in coming weeks risking a crisis at a time when views are hardening, particularly among hardline Republicans who defied their own party leadership to scupper various temporary funding proposals as they pressed for deep spending cuts. The group of 21 had threatened to remove McCarthy as speaker if a stopgap measure they opposed was passed with Democrat support, and many in Washington warn the speaker may have to fight for his job in the coming weeks. One of the hard right group, Lauren Boebert, was clearly unhappy with the outcome, but declined to say what that might mean for McCarthy’s future. “There are too many members here who are comfortable doing things the way they’ve been done since the mid ’90s,” she told reporters. “And that’s why we’re sitting at $33 trillion in debt.” McCarthy dismissed concerns that hardline Republicans could try to remove him as leader. “I want to be the adult in the room, go ahead and try,” McCarthy told reporters. “And you know what? If I have to risk my job for standing up for the American public, I will do that.” Arming and funding Ukraine in its war against theRussian invasionhas been a key policy initiative for Biden, while the stopgap is only temporary, it does raise questions over the political viability of continuing the multibillion-dollar flow of assistance. McCarthy said Russia’s invasion was “horrendous,” but insisted there could be “no blank cheque” for Ukraine. “I have a real concern of what’s going to happen long term, but I don’t want to waste any money,” he said. Last week,Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyyvisited Capitol Hill to try to convince the slowly growing number of sceptical Republican members of Congress not to give up on his country."
"In­dia re­ceives low­est rains in 5 years, agri­cul­tur­al pro­duc­tion to be hit",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/30/india-receives-lowest-rains-in-5-years-agricultural-production-to-be-hit,Rain­fall deficit could im­pact crops such as rice and sug­ar push­ing food in­fla­tion amid soar­ing glob­al food prices.,"India’s monsoon rainfall this year was its lowest since 2018 as the El Nino weather pattern made August the driest in more than a century, the state-run weather department said on Saturday, which is likely to affect agricultural production. El Nino is a warming of Pacific waters that is typically accompanied by drier conditions over the Indian subcontinent. The monsoon, which is vital for India’s $3 trillion economy, contributes more than 70 percent of the rain the country needs to water crops and replenish reservoirs and aquifers. Nearly half of the farmland in the world’s most populous nation lacks irrigation, making the monsoon rains even more vital for agricultural production. The summer rainfall deficit could make staples such as sugar, pulses, rice, and vegetables more expensive and lift overall food inflation. Lower production could also prompt India, the world’s second-biggest producer of rice, wheat, and sugar, to impose more curbs on exports of these commodities amid soaring global food prices. Rainfall over the country from June to September was 94 percent of its long-period average, the lowest since 2018, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in a statement. The IMD had anticipated a rainfall deficit of 4 percent for the season, assuming limited impact from El Nino. The monsoon was uneven, with June rains nine percent below average because of the delay in the arrival of rains, but July rains rebounded to 13 percent above average. August was the driest on record with a 36 percent deficit, but again in September rainfall revived and the country received 13 percent more rainfall than normal, the IMD said. The erratic distribution of monsoon rains has led India, the world’s largest rice exporter, to limit rice shipments, impose a 40 percent duty on onion exports, permit duty-free imports of pulses, and could potentially result in New Delhi banning sugar exports. The country is expected to receive normal rainfall from October to December, the weather department said, adding that temperatures were likely to remain above normal in most of the country during October."
US gov­ern­ment shut­down im­mi­nent as law­mak­ers scram­ble to reach agree­ment,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/30/us-government-shutdown-imminent-as-lawmakers-scramble-to-reach-agreement,The clo­sure of all but crit­i­cal gov­ern­ment ser­vices would start on Sun­day af­ter mid­night (04:00 GMT).,"The United States government isheaded towards a shutdownthis weekend as Republicans and Democrats pursued rival stopgap measures to prevent a closure that would disrupt many government services, squeeze federal employees and roil politics. The closure of all but critical government services, set to start on Sunday after midnight (04:00 GMT) if lawmakers fail to reach a deal, would be the first since 2019 – immediately delaying salaries for millions of federal employees and military personnel. “It will have an immediate impact at one minute past midnight [04:01 GMT Sunday]” when “basically large areas of federal institutions shut down”, said Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna, reporting from Washington, DC. “The military is the key issue here because military cheques are due to go out in the middle of October. If the situation is not resolved by then, it means some two million members of the military won’t be getting paid. All federal workers will not be paid. They will be put on leave or they will be forced to work without pay.” The two chambers ofCongress are deadlockedas House of Representatives Republicans, fuelled by hard-right demands to slash budgets, are forcing a confrontation over federal spending – which also includes aid to Ukraine. It is impossible to predicthow long a shutdown would last. The Democratic-held Senate and Republican-controlled House are working on vastly different plans to avert a shutdown, while House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is struggling to win any support from hard-right conservatives to keep the government open. A particular issue has been theinclusion of more aidto Ukraine in the funding package, with a growing number of Republicans staunchly opposed to providing more assistance to the country in its defence against a Russian invasion. McCarthy said he would hold a vote Saturday on a new measure that would keep the government open for another 45 days at current spending levels but without any aid for Ukraine. The bill would require significant Democratic support to pass. If President Joe Biden wants to lobby against it, “then the shutdown is on him”, McCarthy said. The White House has insisted the real negotiation should be between McCarthy and Republican hardliners who scuppered a similar temporary funding measure on Friday, underlying a growing sense of chaos inside the party before next year’s presidential election. “There are those in Congress right now who are sowing so much division, they’re willing to shut down the government tonight,” Biden said on Saturday morning on X, formerly known as Twitter. “It’s unacceptable.” The Democrat-controlled Senate was expected to vote on its own stopgap bill later Saturday – one that does include funding for Ukraine. It is the responsibility of Congress to fund the government. The House and Senate have to agree to fund the government in some way, and the president has to sign the legislation into law. The two sides are deeply entrenched and nowhere near a deal to avert a shutdown. But if theshutdown lasts for weeks, pressure will build to end the impasse, particularly if active-duty military members miss pay dates on October 13 or November 1. If the wider public starts seeing disruptions in air travel or border security as workers go unpaid, it will further goad Congress to act. “It would have a massive effect on the US, not least on the economy, the lack of spending power but also on its international reputation, and this is the type of thing that would undermine the US’s economic standing in the eyes of the rest of the world,” Hanna said.

More than 80 per­cent of eth­nic Ar­me­ni­ans flee Nagorno-Karabakh,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/30/more-than-80-percent-of-nagorno-karabakhs-people-have-fled-armenia-govt,"Ar­men­ian Prime Min­is­ter Nikol Pashinyan says ex­o­dus amounts to ‘eth­nic cleans­ing’, a claim Azer­bai­jan strong­ly re­jects.","An ethnic Armenian exodus has nearly emptiedNagorno-Karabakhof residents since Azerbaijan attacked and ordered the breakaway region’s fighter groups to disarm, the Armenian government has said. Nazeli Baghdasaryan, the press secretary to Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, said on Saturday that 100,417 people had arrived in Armenia from Nagorno-Karabakh, which had a population of approximately 120,000 before Azerbaijan reclaimed the region in a lightning offensive last week. A total of 21,043 vehicles have crossed the Hakari Bridge, which links Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh, since last week, Baghdasaryan said. Some lined up for days because the winding mountain road that is the only route to Armenia became jammed. “The speed of it has caught everyone, including the Armenian authorities and the UN by surprise,” said Al Jazeera’s Bernard Smith. The departure of more than 80 percent of Nagorno-Karabakh’s population raises questions about Azerbaijan’s plans for the enclave that was internationally recognised as part of its territory. “[In Nagorno-Karabakh] we’re seeing scenes of eerie silence, empty streets, empty shops, and vacant homes,” said Al Jazeera’s Osama Bin Javaid, reporting from Horadiz. “Just a fraction of the population remains in this enclave where people have been assured that they will not be persecuted by Azerbaijani forces as they take control of these areas.” The region’s separatist ethnic Armenian government said Thursday it would dissolve itself by the end of the year after a three-decade bid for independence. Pashinyan has alleged the ethnic Armenian exodus amounted to “a direct act of an ethnic cleansing and depriving people of their motherland”. Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly rejected the characterisation, saying the mass migration by the region’s residents was “their personal and individual decision and has nothing to do with forced relocation”. However, Luis Moreno Ocampo, a former ICC chief prosecutor, told Al Jazeera that it is “obvious” what is happening is ethnic cleansing, saying that “the legal description is called genocide.” “It’s an excuse that the Azerbaijan government saying, ‘oh, [leaving] was voluntary’ after they were bombing them and were starving them to death for months,” Ocampo said. During three decades of conflict in the region, Azerbaijan and the separatists backed by Armenia have accused each other of targeted attacks, massacres and other atrocities, leaving people on both sides deeply suspicious and fearful. While Azerbaijan has pledged to respect the rights of ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh, most are fleeing because they do not trust Azerbaijani authorities to treat them humanely or guarantee their language, religion and culture. “None of the people we’ve spoken to have confidence in the Azerbaijan government’s claim that their security would be guaranteed if they decided to stay,” said Smith, Al Jazeera’s correspondent in Yerevan. “They’re frightened because they fear, despite Azerbaijan’s assurances, they fear they will be treated as the losers and the Azerbaijanis will come in as the victors,” he said.  The office of Italy’s prime minister said on Saturday that Armenia has asked the European Union for assistance to help it deal with refugees arriving from Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Defence said later on Saturday that one of its servicemen was killed by sniper fire from Armenian forces in the border district of Kalbajar, but the alleged incident was swiftly refuted by Armenia. Interfax news agency cited the Armenian Ministry of Defence as saying the report was incorrect, without giving further details. After six years of separatist fighting ended in 1994 following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Nagorno-Karabakh came under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia. Then, during a six-week war in 2020, Azerbaijan took back parts of the region in the South Caucasus Mountains along with surrounding territory that Armenian forces had claimed earlier. In December, Azerbaijan blocked the Lachin Corridor, the only road connecting Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia, accusing the Armenian government of using it for illicit weapons shipments to the region’s separatist forces. Weakened by the blockade and with Armenia’s leadership distancing itself from the conflict, ethnic Armenian forces in the region agreed to lay down arms less than 24 hours after Azerbaijan began its offensive. Talks have begun between officials in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku and Nagorno-Karabakh’s separatist authorities on “reintegrating” the region into Azerbaijan."

Vu­cic ‘wants war’: Koso­vo PM ac­cus­es Bel­grade of in­cit­ing vi­o­lence,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/30/vucic-wants-war-kosovo-pm-accuses-belgrade-of-inciting-violence,Koso­vo leader Al­bin Kur­ti al­leges Ser­bian pres­i­dent aims to in­sti­gate a con­flict with Koso­vo; Vu­cic de­nies ac­cu­sa­tion.,"Kosovo’s Prime Minister Albin Kurti says Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic planned and orderedan attack in northern Kosovo“to destabilise” the country with the goal of starting a war. About 30 heavily armed Serbs stormed the village of Banjska last Sunday, fought Kosovo police in a gun battle, and barricaded themselves into a Serbian Orthodox monastery. A Kosovo policeman and three Serb attackers were killed. Hours later, police retook the monastery where they found a large cache of weapons and ammunition. Six wounded members of the armed group were hospitalised in southern Serbia, according to Interior Minister Xhelal Svecla, while other attackers fled. Kurti told Al Jazeera that Serb “paramilitary formations” in Banjska had equipment manufactured in Serbia that cannot be found on the open market. While information is still being gathered by prosecutors and Kosovo police, “what we know is that we’ve confiscated five million euros [$5.3m] worth of ammunition and weapons and it was all manufactured in factories in Serbia,” Kurti alleged. “Hand grenades, machine guns, everything that we confiscated was produced in Serbia and cannot be found on the market. It’s obvious the army of Serbia gave this to the paramilitary formations.” Kurti said the ultimate goal of Sunday’s attack was for Serbia to stage a scenario and raise tensions. “They wanted our police to enter the Banjska monastery so they could then share photos worldwide [showing] bullets on the monastery’s walls. That didn’t happen because our police are very strong and very professional and [the attackers] escaped.” “They only wanted the start of a war to be on Sunday, September 24. [It’s well known] howthe war started in Sarajevo. On March 1, 1992, during a wedding, an Orthodox Serb priest was injured. We were very careful that something similar doesn’t happen. But I think they wanted to repeat the scenarios from the beginning of the war [in former republics of Yugoslavia].”  Kurti said Milan Radoicic, a top Kosovo Serb politician who admitted on Friday that he planned the attack, “received logistical, military equipment and preparation from Belgrade, and also received political orders from President Vucic”, noting their close ties. Radoicic – vice president of the “Serb List”, a Belgrade-supported Serb political party in Kosovo – resigned from his position on Friday and called the attack a “defence” operation against Kosovo authorities. But he has denied any involvement or support by the Serbian government. Dan Ilazi, head of research at the Kosovar Centre for Security Studies, told Al Jazeera that German and US officials also acknowledged the equipment involved would be difficult to acquire without high-level connections. “For instance, one of the grenade launchers they used can only be purchased by the permission of the government in Serbia. Plus, some of the individuals involved in this attack, according to Kosovo police, are part of the security establishment in Serbia,” Ilazi said, adding that Radoicic’s “connections to the Serbian government are very transparent”. “The extent to which the Serbian president himself knew about this attack is debatable … The responsibility over this attack, the evidence presented so far, clearly seems to show participation of Serbian security institutions. “My personal suspicion is that this perhaps is also instigated, or supported or encouraged by Russia, who maintains a strong presence in Serbian security institutions,” Ilazi said.  Vucic and his office did not respond to Al Jazeera about the allegations, but he has denied any government involvement in Sunday’s attack. On Thursday, hetoldthe Reuters news agency that Serbia will investigate the origin of the seized weapons including a cache of assault rifles, anti-tank rocket launchers, hand grenades, land mines and drones. “Why this would be beneficial for Belgrade? What would be the idea? To destroy our position we have been building for a year? To destroy this in a day? … Serbia does not want war,” Vucic said. He said suspects will be investigated and Radoicic would be “summoned by the prosecutor”. In turn, Vucic accused Kurti of wanting to expel Serbs from Kosovo. Kurti’s refusal to form an Association of Serb Municipalities, as part of the 2013 agreement between Belgrade and Pristina that would allocate Kosovo Serbs more autonomy, is what fueled tensions leading to violence in Banjska, he said. Vucic told Serbian TV he has year-old information that Serbs in Kosovo have been preparing for resistance, noting the barricades Serb residents set up more than a year ago. “The situation is boiling … Kurti did this, he united Serbs,” said Vucic. Some 50,000 Serbs who live in north Kosovo do not recognise Pristina institutions and view Belgrade as their capital. Clashes have repeatedly occurred with Kosovo police andNATO-led peacekeepers known as KFOR. But Sunday’s violence was the worst in years. Kurti questioned what a heavily armed Serb paramilitary group was doing in a 14th-century monastery in Banjska. “Who are they defending there? They came to attack… [Vucic] loves war, he wishes for war and he wants war because he wants a Republika Srpska in Kosovo,” Kurti told Al Jazeera, referring to the Serb-led entity in Bosnia and Herzegovina, formed during the Dayton peace agreement in 1995, which formally ended the war but is thesource of much turmoil today. “[Republika Srpska was formed] because there was a war and a genocide in Bosnia. And now he wants a war and one more genocide in Kosovo so he can get a Republika Srpska [in Kosovo], but he won’t,” Kurti added.  Meanwhile on Friday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the United States iscalling on Serbia to withdraw its forces from the border, after it detected an “unprecedented” Serbian military build-up – “a very destabilising development”. In astatementon Friday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he spoke with Vucic to de-escalate tensions. He “welcomed KFOR’s increased presence and the North Atlantic Council’s decision to authorise additional forces”. To avoid such attacks from happening again, Kurti told Al Jazeera two things are urgently needed – security for Kosovo and sanctions for Serbia. “All the time they are running some military drills by our border … I think this is very dangerous. They will think you are either afraid or weak. That’s why the international community – the European community, NATO, the US and the UK – must show and prove to Belgrade that a return to the 1990s will not be allowed.”"

Muhammad Rumaneh from the Amari refugee camp in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah was killed late on Friday, his death prompting a general strike there on Saturday. The Israeli army said Rumaneh and another man threw Molotov cocktails at an army post near Ramallah. The condition of the other Palestinian was unclear. “Soldiers conducting routine activity at the scene identified the suspects and responded with live fire. Two assailants were neutralised and transferred to receive medical treatment,” the army said. Israeli soldiers opened fire at the pair’s car, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa. The Palestine Red Crescent said the army did not allow its ambulances to come to the aid of the two after they were shot, and Rumaneh later died of his wounds, reported Wafa. Hamas said Rumaneh was a member.  Israeli authorities are withholding his body. Unable, therefore, to hold a funeral for the young man, residents of Ramallah called for a general strike to pay tribute to him. Shops and businesses were closed and students stayed home, Wafa reported. Student groups at Birzeit University also called off Sunday classes. Israeli officials have suggested in the past that holding onto the bodies of Palestinians slain in security incidents can deter attacks and prevent the exaltation of assailants at funerals that often draw giant crowds. Violence in the West Bank has intensified in the last year as Israel has stepped up its near-nightly raids. The number of settler assaults on Palestinian villages has also surged. In the past week alone, a Palestinian teenager wasshot in Jenin,while six other Palestinians were killed duringtwo separate raidsin the illegally occupied territory. The United Nations has said 2023 is the deadliest year for Palestinians since it started counting fatalities in 2006. More than 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since the start of the year, according to the health ministry. Palestinian attacks against Israelis have killed at least 30 people since the start of 2023."

Final opinion polls showed the two parties in a dead heat, with the winner expected to get the first chance to try to form a government to replace the caretaker administration running the country since May. A government led by Fico would mean Slovakia, a country of 5.5 million, joining Hungary as European Union countries challenging the bloc’s consensus support for Ukraine, just as the EU looks to shore up solidarity in opposing Russia’s invasion. It would also add to a bloc of eastern former communist states with governments publicly hostile to liberalism. A Progresivne Slovensko (Progressive Slovakia, PS) government would stay the course on foreign policy, keeping Slovakia’s strong backing for Ukraine and putting the country in a pro-integration and liberal camp in the EU on issues such as majority voting to make the bloc more flexible, green policies and LGBTQ rights. Neither Fico’s SMER-SSD (Direction-Slovak Social Democracy) nor the PS, led by European Parliament Vice President Michal Simecka, are expected to win a majority, meaning the future government is likely to depend on results for half a dozen smaller parties, from libertarians to far-right extremists. The moderate-left Hlas (Voice) of Peter Pellegrini, an ex-SMER-SSD member and prime minister from 2018-20, is seen coming third and may have the final say. He has kept his options open but said this week his party was closer to Fico. Fico has ridden on dissatisfaction with a bickering centre-right coalition whose government collapsed last year, triggering this election a half-year early. Fico’s pro-Russian views follow moods in Slovak society, traditionally relatively warm on Russia. Pro-Russian narratives and disinformation on social networks have amplified the sentiment. Fico has pledged to end military supplies to Ukraine and to strive for peace talks. This rhetoric echoes that of Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orban, but is rejected by Ukraine and its allies, who say this would only encourage Russia. He has also criticised sanctions on Russia and defended national veto powers in the EU. But Fico was also a pragmatic leader in the past, which foreign diplomats and analysts say could tame his foreign policy turn. Observers also say Slovakia – with the eurozone’s biggest budget deficit of nearly 7 percent of gross domestic product this year – is in need of EU modernisation and recovery funds. Any government would, therefore, think twice before going into conflict with Brussels over issues such as the rule of law. Polling stations opened at 7am (05:00 GMT) on Saturday and voting ends at 10pm (20:00 GMT). Exit polls will be released after polls close, and results will become available within hours."

"Fate of In­dia ties, democ­ra­cy in bal­ance as Mal­dives votes in run-off",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/30/fate-of-india-ties-democracy-hang-in-balance-as-maldives-votes-in-runoff,Vot­ers in the Mal­dives choose their next pres­i­dent in a run-off elec­tion close­ly watched by Chi­na and In­dia.,"Voters in the Maldives are casting their ballots in a presidential run-off that could determine the fate of the Indian Ocean archipelago’s nascent democracy as well asits ties with China and India. The election on Saturday pits President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, who has championed an India-first policy, against the mayor of the capital, Mohamed Muizzu, whose opposition coalition sought closer ties with China and oversaw a wide-ranging crackdown on dissent while in power from 2013-18. Muizzu emerged as thesurprise frontrunnerduring the first round of voting on September 8, taking some 46 percent of the ballots cast. Solih – hurt by low voter turnout and a split within his Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) – won 39 percent. But with the incumbent leader ramping up his campaign – including with pledges of handouts and warnings of a return to authoritarianism should his opponent win – the run-off looks too close to call, according to observers. Polling opened at 8am local time (03:00 GMT) and will close at 5pm (12:00 GMT).  Vote counting begins immediately afterwards, and the results will likely be known within hours. Some 282,804 people in the country of 500,000 people are eligible to vote.  Here’s what you need to know about the Maldives’s high-stakes election. The run-off has significant implications for the Maldives’ foreign policy, as the outcome could be key in deciding China and India’s battle for influence in the strategically located archipelago. Solih, who won the last election in 2018 amid widespread anger over corruption and human rights abuses under his predecessor, has brought the Maldives closer to India, obtaining more than $1bn in loans for housing and transport projects in the capital, Male. The Maldives owes a similar amount to China. Under Solih’s predecessor, Abdulla Yameen, Beijing funded a first-of-its-kind bridge connecting Male to its neighbouring islands, as well as upgrades to the Maldives’s main international airport. The infrastructure projects have driven the Maldives’ debt to 113 percent of the country’s GDP at the end of 2022, with India and China estimated to hold 26 percent of GDP each. N Sathiya Moorthy, a political commentator based in the Indian city of Chennai, said for both Beijing and New Delhi, Saturday’s election is “about the predictability of their Maldivian relations under the next presidency”. Solih is by now predictable for both, he said, but Muizzu – who is contesting the election after Yameen was jailed on a corruption conviction last year – spells uncertainty. This is because Muizzu’s Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM)-led coalition has launched a vitriolic “India Out” campaign seeking to reduce what it calls New Delhi’s outsized influence in the country’s affairs. “India has become the unnamed issue in this second round of polling with anti-India social media posts doing the rounds much more than in the first,” Moorthy said. A change in government will not only test the country’s foreign policy, but also its fledgling democracy. Muizzu’s opponents say the mayor – who was a cabinet member in Yameen’s government – could return the country to the authoritarianism seen under the former president. While in office, Yameen presided over a wide-ranging crackdown on dissent that included the jailing of nearly all opposition leaders, the prosecution of journalists anda huge corruption scandal, in which tens of millions of dollars were stolen from public coffers and used to bribe judges, legislators and members of watchdog institutions. He also turned a blind eye to the growing presence of groups linked to al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS), even afterthe killing of a young journalistand a blogger. “The Maldivian experiment with democratic politics is still very precarious,” said Azim Zahir, a lecturer and research fellow in international relations and politics at the University of Western Australia in Perth. “This very experiment was under serious threat when PPM was in power. The fact that Muizzu was a cabinet minister of that government makes me really nervous for the future of democracy should he win the election.” Amid the fears, Muizzu has repeatedly pledged not to go after his political opponents. “I do not support brutality,” the 45-year-old mayor told the Dhauru newspaper last week. “I will not take action against my opponents for disagreeing with me … Everyone will have the opportunity [to carry out political activities].”  Solih, meanwhile, has dismissed Muizzu’s assurances. The incumbent has portrayed Saturday’s vote as a contest between democracy and autocracy. “This election is a choice between peace and stability in the Maldives, or brutality, fear and chaos,” the 61-year-old president told supporters on the eve of the run-off. “If you do not vote [for me], the whole of Maldives may have to mourn and shed tears.” With much at stake, the president has sought to win the backing of third, fourth and fifth placed candidates in the first round, but to no avail. The politician who came in third in the first round of voting was Ilyas Labeeb, who won seven percent of the ballots cast. Labeeb was the candidate of the Democrats, a party founded by Parliament Speaker and former President Mohamed Nasheed, who fell out with Solih after losing abitterly contested presidential primaryearlier this year. Nasheed and the Democrats accuse Solih of failing to fulfil campaign pledges he made in 2018 to ensure justice for the Maldives’s biggest corruption scandal as well as the al-Qaeda-linked killings. They also accuse his government of putting in place a vast system of patronage, using state-owned enterprises to buy out the media and hand out thousands of jobs to ensure political loyalty. The government denies the claims. Without the backing of the Democrats, Solih comes to the second round with a “significant disadvantage”, said Ahmed Shaheed, a former Maldives foreign minister and professor of international human rights law at the University of Essex in the United Kingdom. “It is quite striking that [Solih] has not managed to put together a firm coalition. And without an open endorsement from [Nasheed], it is unlikely the Democrats will vote for Solih,” Shaheed said. “It’s going to be a very tight contest,” he added. “I don’t think anyone is in a position to comfortably declare that the election is theirs.”"
"Man killed, one hos­pi­talised af­ter whale hits boat off Aus­tralia",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/30/man-killed-one-hospitalised-after-whale-flips-boat-off-australia,Po­lice say whale breach­ing may have caused boat to flip and throw two oc­cu­pants into the wa­ter off Syd­ney.,"One man died and another was hospitalised in Australia after a whale hit and flipped their small boat during a fishing trip, authorities said. The two men were thrown from the boat when it was hit at about 6am local time on Saturday (20:00 GMT on Friday) in the waters off La Perouse, about 14km (nine miles) southeast of Sydney. People on a second boat raised the alarm after spotting a 4.8-metre vessel unoccupied in the water, police said. The 53-year-old skipper was pulled from the water nearby, treated by paramedics and taken to hospital, where he was in a stable condition, according to authorities. A second man, aged 61, was unconscious and died at the scene. The boat “was likely to have struck or been impacted by a whale breaching, causing the boat to tilt, ejecting both men”, police said in a statement. Water Police Acting Superintendent Siobhan Munro described the collision as a “tragic accident” and told how the skipper of the boat had tried to hold his companion “as close as he could” in an effort to save him. According to Australia’s ABC national broadcaster, Munro said the men could have been in the water for 45 minutes before they were rescued.  Though Australia has an extensive coastline and its waters host 10 large and 20 smaller species of whales,human deaths caused by whales are rare. Humpback and southern right whales travel north to warmer breeding grounds during Australia’s winter months, returning southwards between September and November. “Right now there are lots of whales out there and there are lots of examples of whales breaching next to boats,” Munro said.  New South Wales Maritime executive director Mark Hutchings said that people on the water needed tostay 100 metres away from an adult whale, and 300 metres if the whale is accompanying a calf. “Whales aren’t there to harm anyone, but those interactions can happen,” Hutchings told the ABC. The accident comes less than two weeks after a four-metre humpback whale was struck in the head by a boat propeller off the coast of Western Australia. In June, eight Danish people were rescued when their sailboat capsized in the Pacific Ocean after a collision with one or two whales. "
What is Or­ange Shirt Day and how is it com­mem­o­rat­ed in Cana­da?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/30/what-is-orange-shirt-day-and-how-is-it-commemorated-in-canada,Or­ange Shirt Day aims to ho­n­our In­dige­nous chil­dren who were forced to at­tend res­i­den­tial schools rife with abuse.,"Warning: The story below contains details of residential schools that may be upsetting. Canada’s Indian Residential School Survivors and Family Crisis Line is available 24 hours a day at 1-866-925-4419. On Saturday, Canada marks the annualNational Day for Truth and Reconciliationto honour the Indigenous children who were forced to attend so-called residential schools and recognise the system’s lasting effects on Indigenous communities countrywide. The event was established as a federal holiday in 2021. Held each year on September 30, it coincides with an Indigenous-led initiative known as Orange Shirt Day. Both aim to commemorate the more than 150,000 First Nations, Inuit and Metis children who were forced to attend institutions of forced assimilation between the late 1800s and 1990s. Run by churches, but funded by the Canadian government, residential schools were rife with physical, mental and sexual abuse, neglect and otherforms of violence. They created a cycle of intergenerational trauma for Indigenous people across the country. Here’s all you need to know about Orange Shirt Day:  Orange Shirt Day began a decade ago as a call by Indigenous people to honour residential school survivors, their families and their communities, as well as all the children who did not come home from the institutions. The founders of Orange Shirt Day, who later formed the Orange Shirt Society non-profit, first commemorated the day in 2013 in Williams Lake, British Columbia. The date — September 30 — was chosen because that was around the time each year that Indigenous children were separated from their families and sent to the residential schools. The name refers to the orange shirt that Phyllis Webstad, the founder of Orange Shirt Day and a member of Stswecem’c Xgat’tem First Nation, received from her grandmother before she was sent to residential school. When she arrived at St Joseph’s Mission Residential School at age six, “They stripped me, and took away my clothes, including the orange shirt! I never wore it again. I didn’t understand why they wouldn’t give it back to me, it was mine!” Webstadwriteson the Orange Shirt Society’s website. “The color orange has always reminded me of that and how my feelings didn’t matter, how no one cared and how I felt like I was worth nothing. All of us little children were crying and no one cared.” Thousands of people commemorate Orange Shirt Day each year by wearing orange. The day has drawn greater attention amid recent discoveries of unmarked graves on former residential school sites, beginning with theuncovering of the remainsof more than 200 Indigenous children in Kamloops, British Columbia, in May 2021. The graves spurred calls for accountability from the government and churches that ran the institutions, particularly the Roman Catholic Church. In July of last year, Pope Francisapologisedfor the “evil” of residential schools. Marches will take place across Canada on Saturday to commemorate Orange Shirt Day and the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. The latter was created in response to a series of “calls to action”, released by Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The commission — charged with conducting a federal inquiry into the residential school system — concluded in 2015 that the institutions perpetrated “cultural genocide” against Indigenous peoples. In its 94 “calls to action”, the commission advocated for a statutory holiday to ensure “public commemoration” of that violent history and its legacy. In a video shared online in 2016, Webstad said Orange Shirt Day is “a day for survivors to tell their stories and for us to listen with open hearts”. “Every child matters, even if you’re an adult,” she said."
US con­cerned by large Ser­bian mil­i­tary mo­bil­i­sa­tion near Koso­vo,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/30/us-concerned-by-large-serbian-military-mobilisation-near-kosovo,Unit­ed States urges Bel­grade to stand down af­ter de­ploy­ment of Ser­bian tanks and ar­tillery near Koso­vo bor­der.,"The United States has urged Belgrade to pull its forces back from the border with Kosovo after detecting what it called an “unprecedented” Serbian military build-up. Serbia has deployed sophisticated tanks and artillery near the frontier with Kosovo afterdeadly clashes erupted at a monasteryin northern Kosovo last weekend, the White House warned on Friday. The violence – in which a Kosovar police officer and three Serb gunmen were killed – marked one of thegravest escalations in tension for yearsbetween Serbia and the former breakaway province that is now Kosovo. “We are monitoring a large Serbian military deployment along the border with Kosovo,” White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters. “That includes an unprecedented staging of advanced Serbian artillery, tanks, mechanised infantry units. We believe that this is a very destabilising development,” he said. “We are calling on Serbia to withdraw those forces from the border,” he added.  The build-up took place over the past week though its purpose was not yet clear, Kirby said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken telephoned Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic earlier on Friday to urge “immediate de-escalation and a return to dialogue”, Kirby added. Vucic has not directly denied there had been a recent build-up but rejected claims that his country’s forces were on high alert. “I have denied untruths where they talk about the highest level of combat readiness of our forces because I simply did not sign that and it is not accurate,” Vucic told reporters on Friday. “We don’t even have half the troops we had two or three months ago.” Serbia said Wednesday that the defence minister and head of the armed forces had gone to visit a “deployment zone” but gave no further details. US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan also spoke with Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti and “expressed concern about Serbian military mobilisations”, according to a statement following the call. Kurti said later on social media that he had “requested increased assistance against Serbia’s warfare plans” from the US.  The two also “discussed the EU-facilitated dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia, which Mr Sullivan underscored was the only long-term solution to ensuring stability throughout Kosovo”, according to a readout of the phone call. The military build-up follows clashes last weekend that began when heavily armed Serb gunmen ambushed a patrol a few miles from the Serbian border, killing a Kosovar police officer.  Several dozen assailants then barricaded themselves at an Orthodox monastery, sparking an hour-long firefight in which three gunmen were killed and three were arrested. Kosovo’s government accused Belgrade of backing the armed operation, while a member of a key Kosovo Serb political party admitted to leading the gunmen, his lawyer said Friday. Kirby said the attack had a “very high level of sophistication”, involving around 20 vehicles, “military-grade” weapons, equipment and training. “It’s worrisome. It doesn’t look like just a bunch of guys who got together to do this,” he said. The NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo known as KFORwill be “increasing its presence” following the attack, Kirby added.  NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg confirmed that the alliance was ready to boost the KFOR force to deal with the situation. Kosovo broke away from Serbia in a bloody war in 1998-99and declared independence in 2008 – a status Belgrade and Moscow have refused to recognise. Relations have long been strained between Kosovo’s ethnic Albanian majority and Serb minority and tensions have escalated sharply in recent months in northern Kosovo. "
Sec­ond ar­rest af­ter felling of Eng­land’s fa­mous ‘Sycamore Gap’ tree,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/30/second-arrest-after-felling-of-englands-famous-sycamore-gap-tree,Man in his 60s ar­rest­ed fol­low­ing ear­li­er ar­rest of 16-year-old for cut­ting down of an­cient tree at UN­ESCO site in UK.,"Police in the United Kingdom made their second arrest overthe cutting down of an ancient tree that stood for hundreds of yearsnear the Roman landmark of Hadrian’s Wall in the northeast of England – an apparent act of vandalism that has shocked the UK. Hours after a 16-year-old was freed on bail, Northumbria Police said on Friday that a man in his 60s was arrested and is being questioned in custody for what detectives described as a “deliberate act of vandalism”. “The senseless destruction of what is undoubtedly a world-renowned landmark, and a local treasure, has quite rightly resulted in an outpouring of shock, horror and anger throughout the North East and further afield,” Detective Chief Inspector Rebecca Fenney-Menzies said. “I hope this second arrest demonstrates just how seriously we’re taking this situation, and our ongoing commitment to find those responsible and bring them to justice,” she added. Police said their investigation is ongoing and have appealed to the public for any further information regarding the felling of the tree. “Any information – no matter how small or insignificant you think it may be – could prove absolutely crucial to our enquiries,” the force said on social media.   Why anyone would want to cut down one of England’s most iconic trees has left people across the UK baffled and angry. Following centuries of industrialisation and urbanisation, Britain is considered to be one of the most deforested countries in Europe. The tree was one of the main landmarks along Hadrian’s Wall, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built nearly 2,000 years ago when Britain was part of the Roman Empire to guard its northwestern frontier. For generations, walkers have paused to admire and photograph the tree at Sycamore Gap, which was made famous when it appeared in Kevin Costner’s 1991 film, Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves. The National Trust, which for more than 125 years has sought to protect the country’s heritage and natural landscapes, said it is currently “making the site safe, and helping staff and the community come to terms with the news”. The tree, which was cut down near the base of its trunk, could grow again, experts said, though they cautioned that it would never be the same. “It’s worth a try,” said Rob Ternent, head gardener at The Alnwick Garden nearby. “It’ll be very difficult to get it back to the original tree,” he said. “It was about 300 years old, so it’ll take a long time to get back to that size,” he added."
"Elite US Navy SEALs, army spe­cial forces to be test­ed for drug use",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/30/elite-us-navy-seals-army-special-forces-to-be-tested-for-drug-use,"US Navy to be­gin ran­dom test­ing of elite unit in No­vem­ber, US Army spe­cial forces will im­ple­ment test­ing at lat­er date.","The US military will begin random drug tests on its special forces,including the Navy SEALsand the Army’s Delta Force, Green Berets and Ranger Regiment, for steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs beginning in November. US Rear Admiral Keith Davids, commander of Naval Special Warfare Command, said on Friday that the testing was necessary to protect the health of soldiers and military readiness. The Navy will be the first to begin random testing in November and the US Army Special Operations Command said it will soon follow suit, although no start date has been set. The US Air Force and the Marine Corps special forces commands said they have not yet requested a similar policy of random drug testing. The use of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs has been a limited but persistent problem across the US military, but leaders in the armed forces have baulked at increased testing.  The US military services have done occasional tests when they perceive a problem with an individual service member, but they must get special permission from the Pentagon to do routine, random testing. According to the Navy command, four military units will be randomly selected each month, and 15 percent of each will be tested. That will amount to as many as 200 sailors monthly, and those testing positive face discipline or removal. A driving factor in the announcement, which has been in the works for months, was the death of a Navy SEAL candidate early last year. Kyle Mullen, 24, collapsed and died of acute pneumonia just hours after completing the SEALs’ gruelling Hell Week test. A report concluded that Mullen, from Manalapan, New Jersey, died “in the line of duty, not due to his own misconduct”. Although tests found no evidence of performance-enhancing drugs in his system, a report by the Naval Education and Training Command (NETC) said he was not screened for some steroids because the needed blood and urine samples were not available, and that multiple vials of drugs and syringes were later found in his car. A broader investigation by the NETC into SEAL training flagged the use of performance-enhancing drugs as a significant problem among those seeking to become elite US commandos and recommended far more robust testing. Investigations in 2011, 2013 and 2018 into suspected steroid use by SEAL candidates led to discipline and requests for enhanced testing. The new random testing will require that sailors provide two urine samples. One will be sent to the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory, a cutting-edge lab used by international sports to test for doping, and one will go to the Navy Drug Screening Laboratory Great Lakes to check for standard drugs. If the test result is positive, the sailor will be notified, there will be a preliminary inquiry and if there is no legal reason for the drugs, the sailor will be subject to discipline and removal from the force."

Ear­ly-morn­ing shoot­ing near US-Mex­i­co bor­der leaves two mi­grants dead,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/30/early-morning-shooting-near-us-mexico-border-leaves-two-migrants-dead,The in­ci­dent un­der­scores on­go­ing risks for mi­grants and asy­lum seek­ers in bor­der ar­eas that crim­i­nal gangs con­trol.,"Two Mexican migrants have been shot to death on the Mexican side of the border with the United States, Mexico’s National Migration Institute said. The incident occurred in the early hours of Friday morning. Another three people suffered gunshot wounds but were assisted by one of the institute’s emergency rescue teams, along with nine others who were not injured. Rescue services found the group of 14 Mexican nationals at dawn on Cuchuma Hill near Tecate, a city in the border state of Baja California. By the time rescuers climbed up to meet the group, two migrants were already dead. The harsh desert hill is considered a sacred site by at least one Mexican Indigenous group, but it is also used byhuman smugglers. The cause of the shooting is not known, but border crossings in certain regions can involve agreements with local cartels for the right of passage. Migrants and asylum seekers are sometimes shot if their smuggler is working for a rival gang or if they haven’t paid passage rights. Migrants and asylum seekers are also often robbed by roving gangs of thieves and kidnappers in border areas. In one notable case in 2021, Tamaulipas state police shot and killed 19 people on the border, including at least 14 Guatemalan migrants. A court recently convicted 11 officers of homicide. In that case, officers had initially argued they were responding to shots fired and believed they were chasing Gulf cartel vehicles. But the state police burned the bodies in an attempt to cover up the crime. The two dead in Tecate are the latest in arapidly growing numberof migrants and asylum seekerskilled or injuredon Mexico’s northern and southern borders in a desperate bid to reach the US. In Chiapas, one of three southern Mexican states to border Guatemala, a truck flipped on the highway on Thursday, killing two Central American migrants and injuring another 27. And on Friday, Mexico’s Migration Institute said 52 migrants were travelling in an overcrowded dump truck when the driver lost control and overturned. The injured, including six children, were transported to hospital, where they were all granted legal cards of asylum, as victims of a crime on Mexican territory. Just the day before the crash, two more Central American migrants died after trying to board a moving train in the state of Coahuila near the Texas border."
Par­adise prison: How 107 Bangladeshis be­came en­slaved on a Pa­cif­ic is­land,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/9/30/paradise-prison-how-107-bangladeshis-became-enslaved-on-a-pacific-island,"In­stead of le­git­i­mate jobs, 107 men from Bangladesh be­came slaves in Van­u­atu work­ing un­der the threat of harm, death.","Port Vila, Vanuatu– When Bangladeshi businessman Mustafizur Shahin left for a job opportunity overseas he did not expect to be held captive on a Pacific island, forced to work without pay, physically abused when he complained and saved only after he made a daring escape. What had promised to be a chance of a lifetime, working with a millionaire entrepreneur and his chain of clothing boutiques, turned out to be a case of modern-day slavery where the threat of physical injury and even death hung over 50-year-old Shahin. Shahin said he felt he was “a living dead body” when recounting events that brought him from the streets of Bangladesh to the shores ofthe Pacific nation of Vanuatuto toil in slavery with little food and in constant fear. “I couldn’t speak. My heart was broken,” Shahin would tell police after his escape. “All my dreams and expectations were mixed with dust,” he said. Shahin is just one among more than 100 Bangladeshi men brought to the tiny nation between 2017 and 2018 as part of a scheme headed by fellow Bangladesh national, Sekdah Somon, a trafficker who posed as the owner of an international chain of fashion boutiques. The case of the 107 Bangladeshi men would become the largest documented incident of human trafficking and slavery in the Pacific Islands region. Yet, five years after Shahin’s and his colleagues’ abuse and torture first came to light, authorities fear countries such as Vanuatu continue to be destinations for vulnerable people seeking a better life, only to be conned and forced into illegal immigration and slavery. Understanding how the abuse of 107 Bangladeshi men passed unnoticedfor so long, despite warning signs, shows how seemingly legitimate foreign recruitment operations have come to disguise criminal networks, and the vulnerability of the Pacific Islands to trafficking operations. Shahin’s ordeal began in June 2018, when he met associates of Bangladeshi businessman Sekdah Somon at a bus station in Tangail, northwest of Dhakar. Somon was a “multimillionaire businessman”, Shahin was told, and ran fashion businesses around the world. Shahin did his homework. Mr Price, the popular South African fashion retailer Somon claimed to work for, had a prominent footprint online. He saw an article, written in Vanuatu’s local newspaper just days earlier, that proclaimed “Mr Price was coming” to the Pacific country. It quoted Somon and senior Vanuatu ministers talking excitedly about the new project. It all seemed to check out in Shahin’s mind. After taking out a loan against his own small but successful garment business in Bangladesh, and paying thousands of dollars to Somon and his associates to organise his travel, Shahin packed his bags, said goodbye to his wife and children, and boarded a flight to Vanuatu to take up a new role with Mr Price. That was five years ago. Shahin has still not returned home. Shahin’s passport was swiftly taken from him when he arrived in capital Port Vila, a town known as a popular destination for luxury cruise ships docking in the Pacific. But he was held captive in a seaside bungalow, and existed mostly on cabbage and rice. His movements were restricted. On the only occasion he was offered meat, Shahin was told to carve up a pregnant cow’s carcass if he wanted protein to eat. He believes being asked to butcher the animal was just another torment in a litany of abuse overseen by the slavery operation’s ringleader, Somon. Vanuatu’s public prosecutor would eventually find Somon, his wife, and two accomplices guilty in 2022 of human trafficking, slavery, money laundering, threats to kill, assault and contravening the country’s employment laws. “Sekdah Somon constantly spoke about what he would do to the victims, like running over them in his car, cutting them up and hanging them from a tree, taking them to the jungle and putting them in a freezer. Sometimes it would end up with a threat that pictures of their dead bodies would be taken and sent to their respective families,” Vanuatu’s Chief Justice Vincent Lunabek wrote, while finding the four defendants guilty in 2022. Shahin told Al Jazeera that he had never doubted the constant threats. On the day he arrived in Vanuatu, he was punched by Bangladeshi men acting as Somon’s enforcers on the island. Shahin’s captors then extorted $14,000 from him in a matter of weeks. And if the money ran dry, he was told photos of him hanging upside down, tortured and bloody, would be sent to his family in Bangladesh. Angry, scared and hopeless, before daybreak one morning, Shahin and two other victims – as their captors were still sleeping – escaped from the bungalow where they were being held. They ran to the beach and followed the shoreline to the nearest road, where Shahin flagged down a passing van. “Police station,” he told the motorist.  In just a few months, Somon was able to traffic Shahin and dozens of other Bangladeshi men into Vanuatu without raising the suspicions of authorities. Many were told they were travelling legally to Australia, Cuba or the French Pacific territory of New Caledonia to work in Somon’s Mr Price boutiques. Forged business documents and licences, as well as bribes, allowed the traffickers to overcome customs clearances and immigration in Vanuatu. Somon’s victims became his slaves, working for little or nothing under the threat of violence. Once the recruited men landed in Vanuatu they were forced to work in construction, according to a news report. The workers were also forced to make and sell wooden furniture. If they refused or complained they were beaten. Their promised jobs and wages never materialised. Investigators believe Somon had no intent to create a real business venture in Vanuatu, but simply wanted to take money from his victims and leave them stranded. A flimsy Mr Price showroom was built in the centre of town. Investigators would later find that Somon had simply taken the brand and logo from the South African company. Hundreds of people would walk past the storefront every day not knowing that it was a front for an unsophisticated slavery operation. When Somon was eventually arrested, he denied he was from Bangladesh, and claimed he was a Zimbabwean national, though investigators later discovered his passport was forged. Bangladesh ranks as thesixth largest source of migrants globally, and many of them rely on expensive recruiters or “dalals” who act as informal middlemen between prospective workers and employers abroad. The situation puts thousands of Bangladeshis at risk of trafficking each year by agents who deceive or exploit migrants with fake promises of good jobs and profits abroad. Some of the recruiters have themselves been victims of trafficking. “In absolute numbers, Bangladeshi people are among the most commonly detected victims of trafficking worldwide,” a2022 study on trafficked persons in Bangladeshstates. Abdusattor Esoev, chief of mission of International Organization for Migration Bangladesh, said many victims of trafficking were fed “a big lie” that they could secure theirs and their children’s lives by migrating abroad. “Many people spend their wealth and lifetime savings and dream about going abroad, especially in developed countries,” he said. “Some end up being trafficked, where they are pushed into forced labour, sexual exploitation or debt bondage.” The head of Vanuatu’s transnational crime unit, Charlie Willie Rexona, says foreign workers from the Philippines and other Asian countries often tell him their passports are kept by their bosses – a clear sign of human trafficking “Trafficking is happening. Smuggling is still happening here. But it is not being reported,” he said. Senior Inspector Willie Rexona, who became a lead investigator in the case, believes Somon got away with the money-making scheme simply because the crime was so new in his country. “They tried to set up his scam in other countries like PNG, the Federated States of Micronesia, they were testing lots of other countries,” Willie Rexona said, adding that the traffickers decided on Vanuatu after identifying “loopholes” in its laws. “Our people tend to keep to themselves; they just aren’t aware of the indicators of trafficking, even amongst immigration officials,” he said.  The unique nature of the crime and the number of Somon’s victims posed problems during the lengthy and tedious trial in Port Vila. The Vanuatu government did not have the means to feed and accommodate the 107 victims, who were now key witnesses. After starving for months in Somon’s captivity, many would go hungry once again while justice took its slow course. Then there was the difficulty in actually prosecuting Somon and his associates. Vanuatu lacks any specific laws that define slavery and trafficking, so Vanuatu’s Public Prosecutor Josiah Naigulevu was forced to use international conventions, so far untested in Vanuatu courts, to bring his charges against the four defendants. “What I did was I looked at what conventions that Vanuatu had ratified,” Naigulevu said. “There was UNTOC, the United Nations Convention [Against] Transnational Organised Crime, and it had elements touching on both slavery and, and trafficking persons,” he told Al Jazeera His legal tactic worked, and the judge ultimately accepted the charges in what would become the region’s largest trafficking case. In June 2022, Somon, who was 37 at the time, and his 27-year-old wife, Buxoo Nabilah Bibi, and two other collaborators, were sentenced for trafficking, enslavement, money laundering, assault, threats to kill and employing non-citizens without work permits. Somon is still in jail in Vanuatu, serving a 14-year sentence. His wife and two associates were given sentences about half as long, but were released on parole earlier this year and deported to Bangladesh after paying a fine. Director of Corrections Johnny Marango told local media at the time that it was “normal” to deport foreign detainees. The four criminals were also ordered to compensate the 107 victims a total of more than $1m, but this amount has not been paid. Compared with other countries, Naigulevu believes the sentences were light. “We need to review the law in this country in terms of maximum sentence,” Naigulevu told Al Jazeera. “Because obviously, when they created this law, they didn’t anticipate a trafficking case of this scale,” he said.  Since the trial, all of the victims have returned to Bangladesh, except Shahin. Since he became one of the key witnesses in the case, he fears Somon and his associates could target him if he dared return to Bangladesh. He feels it is safer to remain living in Vanuatu and he has brought his wife and children to live with him. “I’m feeling much safer than before because I just worried about my kids,” Shahin told Al Jazeera. Shahin’s ordeal is not yet over. His immigration status is in limbo in Vanuatu and his attempts to gain refugee status through the United Nations have been knocked back. He still has hope, though, and his sights remain set on migrating one day to a place where he can provide a better life for his family. But, for now, Vanuatu is a safer home than Bangladesh, Shahin said. “I hope I can settle in Canada or Australia or somewhere because I still struggle to live here in Vanuatu.”"

That is the deadline to approve new budget legislation to fund the United States government over the next fiscal year — which starts on Sunday. But with a faction of hardline Republicans refusing to pass any sort of legislation without massive cuts to discretionary funding, the country is now staring at a possible shutdown of all federal functions deemed non-essential. Even those considered essential won’t get fully paid, said Justin Begley, an economist at Moody’s Analytics, although they will receive their full salaries once the shutdown is over. “We’ve reached this point because political partisanship seems to be elevated,” Begley explained. While the US Congress decides what is essential and what isn’t — the line is typically drawn at safety — no government funds means no government spending. That could leave hundreds of thousands of federal workers without pay, and millions of citizens without access to programmes like nutrition assistance. Depending on the length of the shutdown, the US economy overall could also worsen. A two- to four-week shutdown is the most likely scenario, said Begley. And while that would have some impact on the economy — economists differ over how bad the situation could get —  there is also concern that the US’s credit rating could suffer, driving up interest rates for government loans. Last month, Fitch Ratings downgraded US credit rating by one notch on the back of the debt ceiling crisis and political divisions. Earlier this week,Moody’s warneda shutdown would negatively affect the government’s credit: It currently lists the US as having a AAA rating, the highest possible. Around a quarter of the US gross domestic product is government expenditure. If that spending were “severely dented”, Begley said it would have all kinds of knock-on effects on investments and consumption, affecting the economy as a whole. For every week the shutdown persists, there could be potential losses of 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points of quarterly economic growth, according to Jared Bernstein, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Economists at Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, put that number down to0.2 percentagepoints for each week of shutdown. In case of a four-week shutdown, Moody’s predicts a 0.4 percentage point reduction in the GDP, but that figure is not certain as there’s a compounding effect, Begley said, which could drive that number higher. The worst-case scenario is a full quarter shutdown. That could cause a 2 percentage point reduction in GDP growth, Moody’s estimates. “Lost hours, wages, productivity from federal government workers … will drag down the GDP,” said Begley.  While economists expect some recovery once back pay comes in for government employees, there will be a permanent loss of hours and wages from the roughly five million government contractors, slightly half of whom are expected to be impacted by the shutdown. A long shutdown also means fewer small business loans and fewer companies listed on the stock market. Indeed, Gary Gensler, the chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, urged companies that were ready to list to do so before the shutdown: If nonessential government services are frozen, the process of reviewing companies to go public on the stock market will slow to a crawl. All of that is on top of a second month of low consumer confidence in September. Then there’s another scenario. If the shutdown lasts the entire quarter and hits January 1, the government will be forced to make an automatic one-percent cut in discretionary spending, giving the hardline Republicans at least some of what they want. At the moment, the options to avoid a shutdown are dwindling. Each year, Congress must pass 12 appropriations bills to keep the government running — but that process is unlikely to be completed before time runs out. In lieu of that, Congress could instead push through a stopgap measure — called a “continuing resolution” or CR — to temporarily fund the government while it continues work on the appropriations bills. But hardline Republicans have rejected the prospect of a short-term fix. “CRs have only made the American economy worse off,” one of those congresspeople, Andy Biggs, wrote on social media. While Friday’s stopgap measure in the House of Representatives shot down in a vote of 198 to 232, House Democrats are pinning their hopes on a separate bipartisan stopgap that could potentially arrive from the Senate. It is unclear, though, whether House Speaker Kevin McCarthy — the leading Republican in the lower chamber — would introduce the Senate’s bill on the House floor. Far-right Republicans have threatened to revoke his speakership if he does. “It is becoming increasingly clear that Republicans will bear the brunt of the blame for the shutdown, which may lower the partisan walls between McCarthy and his allies and the Democrats in the House and Senate,” said Begley. However, it remains unclear whether the scrutiny on Republicans will translate into effective action. “The added pressure means that a shorter two- to three-week shutdown is still possible, but heightened intraparty tensions increases the risk that the shutdown becomes a bit more lengthy,” he added."
Key US law­mak­er calls to pause mil­lions of dol­lars in aid to Egypt,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/key-us-lawmaker-calls-to-pause-millions-of-dollars-in-aid-to-egypt,Top De­mo­c­rat on House for­eign pol­i­cy pan­el calls for with­hold­ing US as­sis­tance over Cairo’s hu­man rights record.,"A top Democratic lawmaker in the United States has urged pausing hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Egypt over human rights concerns, amid growing calls to slash assistance. Congressman Gregory Meeks, the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, made the request on Friday, saying that Egypt failed to meet thehuman rightscriteria set by lawmakers to receive the aid. US lawmakers had placed human rights conditions on $320m of the $1.3bn that Cairo receives annually from Washington. But the administration of President Joe Biden waived the conditions earlier this month on grounds that the assistance advances US national interests. It ultimatelywithheld only $85m. “Today, I requested the State Department pause a portion of US military financing to Egypt that is conditioned on human rights criteria,” Meeks said in a statement, referring to the remaining $235m. “Congress needs more clarity from the State Department on how concerns about treatment ofpolitical prisoners, journalists, as well as the rule of law are being tackled in our bilateral relationship.”  The call comes as key DemocraticSenator Bob Menendezfaces corruption charges over allegations that he accepted bribes to deliver political favours, including advancing the Egyptian government’s interests in Washington. Menendez, who stepped down from his role as the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee after the charges, hasdenied wrongdoingand pleaded not guilty. But his indictment has led to renewed demands in Congress to reassess assistance to Egypt. “It’s a devastating series of allegations, and as a committee, we now have a responsibility to understand what Egypt was doing and what Egypt thought it was getting,” Chris Murphy said earlier this week. “There are serious implications for US policy towards Egypt if – as the indictment suggests – they were trying to use illicit means to curry favour on the committee.” Meek’s statement on Friday did not address Menendez’s charges, but the congressman pledged to push to “ensure human rights and national security are integral pillars”. Rights groups have accused the government of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, which came to power in a 2013 military coup, of jailing tens of thousands of dissidents and outlawing virtually all forms of political opposition. Cairo has denied holding political prisoners.  Egypt launched a so-called “National Human Rights Strategy” in 2021 to improve its record, but rights groups have dismissed the effort. Amnesty International, for instance, called it a “shiny cover-up” for “unrelenting” abuses. Egypt is a top US ally in the Middle East and North Africa. While Biden administration officials have offered some verbal criticism of Egypt over human rights, they often praise Cairo’s mediating efforts between Israel and Palestinian groups in Gaza. As a candidate, Biden promised to prioritisehuman rightsin his foreign policy and criticised his predecessor Donald Trump’s close ties with el-Sisi. “No more blank checks for Trump’s ‘favorite dictator’,” he wrote in a social media post in 2020, referring to the Egyptian president."
Pro­test­ers con­front se­cu­ri­ty forces as Iran marks an­niver­sary of crack­down,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/protesters-confront-security-forces-as-iran-marks-anniversary-of-crackdown,Clash­es came as a re­port­ed riot took place at a prison in south­west Iran.,"Clashes erupted in Iran’s restive southeast on Friday to mark the first anniversary of acrackdown by security forceson protesters known as “Bloody Friday”, according to rights groups and social media videos. Videos posted on social media by the Iran Human Rights (IHR) group showed marchers confronting security forces in Zahedan, capital of the southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan province, as apparent sounds of shooting are heard. IHR and the Baluch rights group Hal Vash said at least 23 people had been injured. The clashes came on the heels of an incident at a facility in southwest Iran in which prisoners started a fire to protest against a death sentence issued against a fellow inmate, and shots were heard, an Iranian news agency reported. “Following the announcement of the death sentence of a prisoner in Ramhormoz prison, several prisoners have started a riot by starting a fire,” the semi-official news agency Mehr reported on Friday. “Gunfire could be heard from outside the prison.” Mehr later reported that “calm” had been restored. Back in Zahedan, protests continued into the night, with several videos posted online purporting to show protesters setting fire to tyres to block streets. Zahedan’s prosecutor had earlier said the city was calm and videos showing the injured were old, the state news agency IRNA reported. The semi-official news agency Tasnim said police had used tear gas to disperse “a few people who had gathered and were throwing rocks at security forces”.   Internet monitor Netblocks reported a “significant disruption” to the internet in Zahedan on Friday, saying authorities had “systematically shut down telecoms to suppress weekly anti-government protests”. On September 30, 2022, security forces killed at least 66 people in a crackdown, according to Amnesty International. Authorities accused protesters, angered by the alleged rape of a girl from the Baluch minority by a police commander, of provoking the clashes. Molavi Abdolhamid, Iran’s most prominent Sunni leader and a longtime critic of Tehran’s Shia leaders, demanded justice for the victims of the September 30 crackdown. “The people’s demand in the past year has been that those who committed this crime be brought to Islamic justice … but judges don’t have independence in Iran,” Abdolhamid said in a sermon posted online Sistan-Baluchestan, which borders Pakistan and Afghanistan, is one of Iran’s poorest provinces and a major drug trafficking route. Human rights groups have said theBaluch minority, up to two million people, has faced discrimination and repression for decades. Iran has said developing the region and resolving its problems is a “serious issue” for the government. Zahedan has also been the scene of weekly protests since a wave of nationwide unrest triggered last year by the death ofMahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in the custody of morality police that shook Iran.

"Scott Hall, Trump ally in­dict­ed in Geor­gia elec­tion case, pleads guilty",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/scott-hall-trump-ally-indicted-in-georgia-election-case-pleads-guilty,"A Geor­gia bond bails­man, Hall was ac­cused of par­tic­i­pat­ing in an ef­fort to re­move and tam­per with elec­tion equip­ment.","Scott Hall, one of the19 co-defendantsin a case over election interference in the state of Georgia, has pleaded guilty to five criminal counts as part of a deal with Fulton County prosecutors in the United States. He becomes the first to plead guilty in thewide-ranging case, which alleges that former President Donald Trump and allies engaged in a “criminal enterprise” to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential race. As part of the deal, Hall agreed to testify in future proceedings. He received five years probation and a fine of $5,000 in exchange for pleading guilty to five misdemeanour counts of conspiring to commit intentional interference with the performance of election duties. Hall, a Georgia bail bondsman, was also one of thefirst to surrenderto Fulton County authorities in August, when the 19 co-defendantsfaced a deadlineto turn themselves in. He originally faced seven felony charges — including conspiracy to defraud the state, computer theft and unlawful possession of ballots — based on allegations he helped breach election equipment in rural Coffee County, Georgia, in a failed effort to prove Trump’s false claims of voter fraud. Trump, a Republican, has long maintained without evidence that the 2020 election was “stolen” from him. His Democratic rival, current President Joe Biden,narrowly wonkey swing states likeGeorgia, thereby propelling him to the White House. But in the weeks after the 2020 vote, Georgia prosecutors contended that Trump and his supporters “knowingly and willfully joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome of the election” in the state. Trump and top allies like erstwhileNew York Mayor Rudy Giulianiand formerWhite House Chief of Staff Mark Meadowswere among the 19 co-defendants ultimately named in the indictment — thefourth set of criminal chargesthe former president faces. It was also his second involving election interference allegations: Afederal indictmentwas filed inWashington, DC, shortly before the state-level charges were announced in Georgia. Trump has denied wrongdoing in all four cases. The prosecutors are pursuing the 19 co-defendants on charges they violated the state’sRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act(RICO), a law often used against organised crime and gang members. It allows prosecutors to charge multiple participants for separate crimes that share the same end goal. Hall is considered a minor player in that alleged conspiracy. Georgia’s indictment explains Hall had “been looking into the election on behalf of the President at the request of David Bossie”, a conservative activist and Trump ally. Those efforts allegedly took a criminal turn on January 7, 2021, just one day after Trump supportersstormed the US Capitolin an attempt to disrupt the certification of the 2020 election results. Hall, who had connections to the state Republican Party, was searching for evidence of voter fraud to back up Trump’s claims, according to prosecutors. He flew from DeKalb County to Coffee County, where local officials — also charged in the indictment — gave him access to the Coffee County Board of Elections and Registration Office. Prosecutors said he was joined at the office by workers hired from the data firm SullivanStrickler, who made copies of data from sensitive election materials, including ballot scanners and hard drives. In a telephone recording filed in a separate court case, Hall can be heard saying: “I’m the guy who chartered the jet to go down to Coffee County, to have them inspect all of those computers.” Hall explains the workers “scanned all the equipment, imaged all the hard drives”, taking copies of votes, both absentee and in-person. “I went down there,” he said. “We scanned every freaking ballot.”"
NATO says it has au­tho­rised bol­ster­ing of forces for Koso­vo,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/nato-says-it-has-authorized-bolstering-of-forces-for-kosovo,"Koso­vo’s prime min­is­ter wel­comed the de­ci­sion, say­ing Ser­bia’s at­tempt­ing to desta­bilise its for­mer province.","NATO has authorised additional forces for Kosovo, the military alliance said, following the worst violence in northern Kosovo in years. Kosovo’s prime minister on Friday welcomed a NATO decision to bolster its troops in the volatile Balkan region, sayinglast weekend’s shootoutthat left four people dead illustrates Serbia’s attempts to destabilise its former province with the help of ally Russia. “These people want to turn back time,” Prime Minister Albin Kurti told The Associated Press. “They are in search of a time machine. They want to turn the clock back by 30 years. But that is not going to happen.” NATO said in a statement that it had “authorised additional forces to address the current situation” but did not immediately specify how many or from which countries. A later statement from the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence said it had transferred command of a battalion of troops to the alliance. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on Friday and stressed the importance of de-escalating tensions with Kosovo after recent violence and the death of a Kosovo police officer, the Department of State said. “The secretary underscored that those responsible for the attacks who are now in Serbia must be held accountable,” it said in a statement. Kosovo police on Friday raided several locations in a Serb-dominated area of the country’s north, where weekend violence left one Kosovo police officer and three Serb fighters dead and further strained relations between Serbia and its former province. Kosovo police said in a statement that they were conducting searches at five locations in three municipalities. The operation was connected to a Sunday shootout between Serb fighters and police officers in the village of Banjska in northern Kosovo. The confrontation was one of the worst since Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, with Belgrade refusing to recognise the split. NATO, which leads the KFOR peacekeeping force in Kosovo, announced Friday that it would strengthen its presence. “We need NATO because the border with Serbia is very long and the Serbian army has been recently strengthening its capacities and they have a lot of military equipment from both the Russian Federation and China,” Kurti said.  Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008 after an armed uprising and 1999 NATO intervention, has accused Serbia of arming and supporting the Serb fighters. Serbia, which has not recognised its former province’s independence, has accused Kosovo of precipitating violence by mistreating ethnic Serb residents. Serbia and Kosovo’s main Serb political group have proclaimed public mourning for the Serbs killed in the battle. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said it had transferred command of the 1st Battalion of the Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment – a reserve force for NATO’s Kosovo Force (KFOR) – to NATO to provide support if required. It said the battalion had recently arrived in the region for a long-planned training exercise."
UN to send mis­sion to Nagorno-Karabakh for first time in near­ly 30 years,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/un-to-send-mission-to-nagorno-karabakh-for-first-time-in-30-years,Ar­me­nia mean­while asked the World Court to or­der Azer­bai­jan to with­draw its troops from civil­ian ar­eas for UN ac­cess.,"The United Nations will send a mission toNagorno-Karabakhfor the first time in about 30 years, scrambling to address humanitarian needs after Azerbaijan retook the territory and triggered a major refugee exodus, a spokesman has said. “Thegovernment of Azerbaijanand the UN have agreed on a mission to the region. The mission will take place over the weekend,” spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Friday. The announcement came on the heels of a request by Armenia to the World Court to order Azerbaijan to withdraw all its troops from civilian establishments inNagorno-Karabakhso that the UN have safe access, the court said on Friday. The World Court, formally known as the International Court of Justice, in February orderedAzerbaijanto ensure free movement through the Lachin corridor to and from the disputed region, in what then was an intermediate step in legal disputes with neighbouring Armenia. In a request for provisional measures submitted on Thursday, Armenia asked the court to reaffirm the orders it gave Azerbaijan in February and to order it to refrain from all actions directly or indirectly aimed at displacing the remaining ethnic Armenians from the region. Some international experts have said theexodus of ethnic Armeniansfrom Nagorno-Karabakh meets the conditions for the war crime of “deportation or forcible transfer”, or even a crime against humanity.  Last week, Azerbaijan’s forces took control of the self-declared state in the mainly ethnic Armenian enclave, prompting residents to flee and stirring fears of ethnic cleansing. Over the years, Azerbaijan and Armenia have fought two wars over the mountainous region. “We haven’t had access to there about 30 years,” said Dujarric, due to the “very complicated and delicate geopolitical situation.” “So, it’s very important that we will be able to get in,” he continued, adding that the mission would do so by air from Azerbaijan. A team of about a dozen people led by the UN’s humanitarian affairs department will assess the needs of people who have remained in the territory and those who are on the move, he added. “And of course, it bears reminding of the need for everyone to respect international law and especially international human rights law,” he said.

Tu­pac Shakur: Wit­ness to rap­per’s shoot­ing charged over 1996 mur­der,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/tupac-shakur-witness-to-rappers-shooting-charged-over-1996-murder,US au­thor­i­ties say Du­ane ‘Keffe D’ Davis ‘or­dered’ the dri­ve-by shoot­ing that killed the cel­e­brat­ed US rap­per.,"One of the last living witnesses to the fatal drive-by shooting of rapperTupac Shakurin Las Vegas has been charged with murder with use of a deadly weapon over the 1996 killing. The charges against Duane “Keffe D” Davis on Friday represent a long-awaited breakthrough in a case that has frustrated investigators and fascinated the public ever since the hip-hop icon was gunned down 27 years ago. Chief Deputy District Attorney Marc DiGiacomo said a grand jury that indicted Davis in Nevada had been seated in the case for “several months”. DiGiacomo described Davis as the “on-ground, on-site commander” who “ordered the death” of Shakur. The charges were revealed hours after Davis, 60, was arrested on Friday morning while on a walk near his home, according to DiGiacomo. Davis has long been knownto investigatorsin the United States and has himself admitted in interviews and in his 2019 tell-all memoir, Compton Street Legend, that he was in the Cadillac from which the gunfire erupted during the September 1996 drive-by shooting. Shakur was 25 when he was killed. Las Vegas police raided a home in mid-July in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson that is tied to Davis.  Police were looking for items “concerning the murder of Tupac Shakur”, according to thesearch warrant. They collected multiple computers, a mobile phone and hard drive, a Vibe magazine that featured Shakur, several .40-calibre bullets, two “tubs containing photographs” and a copy of Davis’ memoir. Clark County District Judge Jerry Wiese denied Davis bail. “It has often been said that justice delayed is justice denied,” District Attorney Steve Wolfson said after the hearing in a brief comment to The Associated Press news agency. “In this case, justice has been delayed, but justice won’t be denied.”  It was not immediately clear if Davis has a lawyer who can comment on his behalf. Davis has not responded to multiple phone and text messages from AP seeking comment or an interview in the more than two months since the house raid. Shakur was in a BMW driven by Death Row Records founderMarion “Suge” Knightin a convoy of about 10 cars. They were waiting at a red light when a white Cadillac pulled up next to them and gunfire erupted. Shakur was shot multiple times and died a week later at the age of 25. The rapper’s death came as his fourth solo album, All Eyez on Me, remained on the charts, with some five million copies sold. Nominated six times for a Grammy Award, Shakur is still largely considered one of the most influential and versatile rappers of all time. In his memoir, Davis said he was in the front passenger seat of the Cadillac and had slipped the gun used in the killing into the backseat, from where he said the shots were fired.  Davis implicated his nephew, Orlando “Baby Lane” Anderson, saying he was one of two people in the backseat. Anderson, a known rival of Shakur, had been involved in a casino brawl with the rapper shortly before the shooting. After the casino brawl, “Mr Davis formulated a plan to exact revenge upon Mr Knight and Mr Shakur” in his nephew’s defence, DiGiacomo said. Anderson died two years later. He denied any involvement in Shakur’s death. Davis revealed in his memoir that he first broke his silence in 2010 during a closed-door meeting with federal and local authorities. At the time, he was 46 and facing life in prison on drug charges when he agreed to speak with them about Tupac’s killing, as well as the fatal shooting six months later of Tupac’s rap rival, Biggie Smalls, also known as the Notorious B.I.G. “They offered to let me go for running a ‘criminal enterprise’ and numerous alleged murders for the truth about the Tupac and Biggie murders,” he wrote. “They promised they would shred the indictment and stop the grand jury if I helped them out.” At the time of their deaths, Shakur and Smalls were in the middle of an East Coast-West Coast rivalry that primarily definedthe hip-hopscene during the mid-1990s.  Greg Kading, a retired Los Angeles police detective who spent years investigating the Shakur killing and wrote a book about it, said he was not surprised by Davis’s arrest. The former police detective said he believed the investigation gained new momentum in recent years following Davis’s public descriptions of his role in the killing, including his 2019 memoir. “It’s those events that have given Las Vegas the ammunition and the leverage to move forward,” Kading said. “Prior to Keffe D’s public declarations, the cases were unprosecutable as they stood.”"
Sui­cide at­tack on tea shop in So­ma­lia cap­i­tal kills at least sev­en,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/suicide-attack-on-tea-shop-in-mogadishu-kills-at-least-seven,"Al-Shabab group claimed re­spon­si­bil­i­ty for the at­tack, which came a day af­ter a dead­ly car bomb­ing in Mo­gadishu.","A suicide bomber blew himself up at a shop selling tea in Somalia’s capital, killing at least seven people, police and witnesses have said. The explosion on Friday occurred inside a tea shop in Bar Bulsho Mogadishu near the presidential palace in central Somalia, said police spokesman Sadik Dudishe. “All the casualties were people spending time to drink tea,” Dudishe said. The cafe is frequented by members of the Somali security forces, as well as civilians. Al Qaeda-linked al-Shabab groupclaimed responsibility for the attack in a statement on its Arabic media unit Shahada News Agency, the SITE Intelligence Group reported on Friday. It put the number of dead at 11 and wounded at 18; its numbers on casualties in attacks often differ from government figures.  Adan Qorey, a resident of the Bar Bulsho area, said the tea shop was often crowded in the afternoon and evening with patrons drinking tea and chewing khat, a mildly narcotic native shrub also known as miraa. The Friday afternoon blast occurred at a checkpoint on a road leading to the parliament and the president’s office and the shop is frequented by soldiers, witnesses said. Friday’s attack came barely a day after five civilians were killed and 13 others wounded in a car bombing near a market in central Somalia. A truck bombing on Saturday in thecentral town of Beledweynekilled 21 people, razing buildings and injuring dozens. In June, al-Shabab, which aims to topple the central government,killed 54 Ugandan soldiersat their base southwest of Mogadishu. The spate of attacks came as Somalia’s beleaguered government has admitted that it has suffered “several significant setbacks” in its fight against al-Shabab fighters. Somalia’s PresidentHassan Sheikh Mohamudtook office in May last year promising an “all-out war” against the fighter group. His government launched a major offensive against al-Shabab in August last year, joining forces with local clan militias in an operation backed by African Union(AU) troopsand US air raids. The group had at one time controlled the capital, until 2011, when it was pushed out by the African Union troops, but it still holds territory in the countryside. "
Dozens dead af­ter Pak­istan rocked by bomb­ings in two provinces,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/isil-regional-branches-likely-behind-twin-blasts-in-pakistan-analysts,Sui­cide bombers at­tacked mosques in the provinces of Balochis­tan and Khy­ber Pakhtunkhwa.,"Islamabad, Pakistan– More than 50 people were killed and many others injured in bomb attacks intwo different Pakistan provinces, officials have said. In the southwestern province of Balochistan, a powerfulbombexploded on Friday near a mosque in Mastung city, where people were gathering to celebrate the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad. Video footage shared on social media showed a large number of people, including many children, standing near the mosque before the bomb blast ripped through the crowd. No one has claimed responsibility, officials in Mastung said, adding that the blast was caused by suicide bombers. Mastung police official Javed Lehri told Al Jazeera that the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an outlawed group also known as Pakistan Taliban, claimed it had “nothing to do with the attack”. “No other group has so far claimed responsibility,” he said, adding that the celebration was organised by two local religious parties. Saeed Mirwani, chief executive of the Shaheed Nawab Ghous Bakhsh Raisani Memorial Hospital in Mastung, said that 52 people died in the explosion. Later in the day, at least five people died and more than 10 were injured after two attackers in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa attempted to enter a police station in Hangu city, Fazal Akbar, a city official, told local media. Police fired upon the attackers and they fled towards a nearby mosque, Akbar said. “One of them blew himself up at the gate, but the second one managed to enter the mosque. Thankfully, most of the people in the mosque managed to escape due to the first blast, which is why our casualty count was less,” he said. Similar to the attack in Mastung, no one claimed responsibility for thesecond bombing. Pakistan Talibanissued a statement condemning both attacks and called the loss of life “tragic”. “The goals of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan are clear. Mosques, seminaries, schools and public gatherings are not among our targets. We have nothing to do with today’s two blasts and we strongly condemn them,” the statement from Pakistan Taliban spokesman Muhammad Khorasani read. The two attacks on Friday come as the country faces a dramatic resurgence in violent attacks against its security officials and civilians. According to data from the Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies (PIPS), an Islamabad-based research organisation, more than 300 attacks have been carried inKhyber Pakhtunkhwathis year. Pakistan has repeatedly urged the neighbouring Afghan government, currently led by the Taliban, to help stem the rising wave of violence. It has alleged that fighters are using Afghan land as safe havens from which to launch attacks on Pakistan,a charge repeatedly denied by the Afghan government.  Iftikhar Firdous, editor of the Khorasan Diary, a research organisation specialising in armed groups in the South Asia region, said the attack in Mastung is the direct consequence of a “virulent ideology which has been nurtured by the Islamic State [ISIL]”. Firdous said that the two regional branches of the ISIL (ISIS) group operating here, the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) and Islamic State Pakistan Province (ISPP), frequently target public ceremonies and locations that achieve maximum casualties. “In Mastung, the ISPP enjoys a strong presence and has carried out multiple major and low-scale attacks in the city, mostly against civilians, regardless of their religious affiliations,” Firdous said. “According to ISKP and ISPP ideology, it is not only permissible, but it is compulsory to target such gatherings, as the group issued several fatwas [religious rulings] advocating for attacks,” he added. Abdul Sayed, a Sweden-based researcher on armed groups in Pakistan and Afghanistan, said that the ISPP is the most likely suspect in the Mastung attack, while ISKP has a stronger presence in areas close to Hangu district. The ISKP has previously claimed responsibility for thedeadly bomb blast earlier in Julywhen more than 50 people died during a political rally in Bajaur district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Sayed said that while the Afghan Taliban have clamped down on the operations of the ISKP, resulting in a decline in their activities, there is a clear upward trend of activity by the ISKP and ISPP in Pakistan. “These attacks are part of ISKP and ISPP’s battle for survival. Perhaps, due to limited resources, the group is attacking soft targets to secure its survival in the regional militant landscape,” he told Al Jazeera. Along with the deteriorating security situation, the country of 241 million people has been grappling with economic uncertainty and political instability over the past year. Pakistan, currently ruled by a caretaker set up after thedissolution of the government in August, is scheduled to hold its general elections in January 2024. Past election campaigns have been marred with violence, with certain political parties were targeted by the Pakistan Taliban, hampering their political campaigning. Asfandyar Mir, a senior expert at the United States Institute of Peace, said that while Pakistan has been primarily concerned about the Pakistan Taliban threat, it appears that ISIL and its affiliates are becoming an increasing problem for the country. “ISIL/ISIS is showing that not only is it a threat in Afghanistan, but increasingly also in Pakistan, and that it has the capability to target the upcoming election in the country,” Mir said. “The group can certainly come in the way of campaigning and even disrupt election activities in select geographies. But whether it can do so at scale is unclear.” "

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on September 18 that his government wasinvestigating“credible allegations of a potential link” between Indian government agents and the June killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a prominent Sikh leader in western Canada. “They [Blinken and Sullivan] obviously shared US views and assessments on this whole situation and I explained to them … the concerns which I had,” Jaishankar said during an event at the Hudson Institute, a conservative US think-tank. “Hopefully we both came out of those meetings better informed.” New Delhi has consistently rejected Ottawa’s allegations of involvement inNijjar’s killing, calling them “absurd” and politically motivated. That denial was echoed by Jaishankar on Friday, who said the official Indian government response to Trudeau, “both in private and public”, has been “that what he was alleging was not consistent with our policy”.  Jaishankar also said the US and India viewed Canada differently, accusing Ottawa of harbouring what he called “terrorists” and organised crime, referring to Sikh separatists whom New Delhi views as a security threat. “It’s a very toxic combination of issues and people who have found operating space there,” he said. The Canada-India dispute escalated further last week as the two nations expelled diplomats from each other’s respective countries, andNew Delhi suspended visa servicesin Canada because of purported threats against its consular staff. Jaishankar said Indian diplomats in Canada “are unsafe going to the embassy or to the consulates” because of a “climate of fear”. “Because there is freedom of speech to make threats and intimidate diplomats, I don’t think that’s acceptable,” Jaishankar later told reporters. Canada also has reported threats on social media against its diplomats in India. Trudeau said last week his country woulddefend its citizensand the “rules-based system” and called on India to cooperate with the Canadian investigation into the killing. But Ottawa has not released specific evidence to back up its accusations of India’s involvement in thekilling of Nijjar. Jaishankar reiterated on Friday thatIndia is opento looking into “anything relevant and specific” that Canada may put forward. For its part, Washington previously voiced support for the Canadian probe, with Sullivan saying the feud with India has not caused friction between the US and Canada. “I firmly reject the idea that there is a wedge between the US and Canada,” Sullivan said last week. “We have deep concerns about the allegations, and we would like to see this investigation carried forward and the perpetrators are held to account.”  The US, arguably Canada’s closest ally, has beendeepening tieswith India – which it sees as a counterweight to China in the Asia-Pacific region – amid Washington’s growing competition with Beijing. A US Department of State readout describing the meeting between Jaishankar and Blinken on Thursday did not mention Canada or the killing of Nijjar. Instead, the State Department hailed a US-brokered project to create a trade corridor from India to Europe, including via rail through Saudi Arabia and Israel, which PresidentJoe Bidenhas viewed as a major achievement. But India has faced criticism from progressives in the US Congress for its human rights record under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “I’m deeply concerned over allegations that Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar was murdered by the Indian government, especially in light of rising threats to the Sikh community,” Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Lee said in a social media post on Thursday. “I support a full investigation to hold the perpetrators accountable & bring justice to his family.” "
Can au­towork­ers fuel a labour re­nais­sance?,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/9/29/can-autoworkers-fuel-a-labour-renaissance,Labour strikes are tak­ing place across North Amer­i­ca as a labour short­age helps work­er de­mand bet­ter pay and rights.,"Towards the end of 1936, autoworkers in Flint, Michigan marched into the nerve centre of General Motors and sparked a match that lit a collective organising flame. Their occupation of key Chevrolet and Buick factories during the Great Depression came to be known as the “sit down strike” for the way the workers put their bodies on the line, physically occupying buildings inside and neutralising the vulnerabilities of a picket line. After a tense few months, the striking autoworkers emerged victorious, with higher wages, and a newly powerful United Auto Workers union, inspiring a wave of other strikes across the country. More than eight decades later, US autoworkers are seeking to trigger a similar movement, with a rebranded “stand up strike” that has captured the nation’s imagination at a time of growing support for unions and mobilisation of workers. “This is a strike that starts small and builds over time, as more and more of us stand up to join the fight,” said UAW President Shawn Fain, as the union launched targeted and simultaneous strikes on September 15 on the big three Detroit automakers: Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which owns Jeep and Chrysler. So far, nearly 20,000 autoworkers across 20 states have been called to strike, with anew set of walkouts announced today. Days after the autoworkers took to the picket lines, the five-monthHollywood writers strike came to an endwith a new contract, bookending the “hot labour summer” that has rippled across North America. From nurses to grocery store clerks, from postal workers to screenplay writers, and railway employees, more workers in the United States and Canada have been walking off the job or threatening to do so, with solidarity also being expressed from Mexico. “They’re sort of feeding off each other,” said Barry Eidlin, a sociology professor at Montreal’s McGill University who studies labour movements. “We haven’t seen this many high-profile strikes happening all at once in a while,” agreed Hayley Brown, a research associate at the Washington, DC-based think tank Center for Economic and Policy Research. “There are definitely things that suggest that this is new,” she noted, but “it remains to be seen how much of a watershed moment it will be.” Increasing strike action is typically a sign of union power. According to the National Labor Relations Board, union representation was up 14 percent in the United States in the first six months of fiscal year 2023, compared with the same period last year. A recent Gallup poll also put union approval at 67 percent in the country this year, making it the fifth straight year it exceeded its long-term average.  But these positive indicators belie the fact that union membership is at an all-time low – just 10 percent of the share of employees in the US, and 6 percent when considering only the private sector. “If I have to put my finger on it, there’s much more of an independent worker-led organising character to what is going on,” said Eidlin. He pointed to the recent unionising atStarbucksandAmazonas proof of grassroots campaigning, along with the emergence of rank-and-file reform movements within the UAW and the UPS Teamsters that have pushed for a more confrontational approach. Eidlin saw a confluence of factors leading to this point, starting with at least 40 years of eroding work quality, stagnating pay and growing inequality. Autoworker wages, for instance, have declined by 30 percent in the last 20 years when factoring in inflation, while CEO pay has increased by 40 percent in the last four years. That apart, employment is less stable. People have to work more hours. Gig work has become normal, and pensions are fraying. Layer on top of that the pandemic, which helped crystallise these pressure points, and in some cases – such as grocery workers who were hailed as heroes and essential, only to see their pandemic pay pulled – added insult to injury. “I think that having a tighter labour market makes people more ambitious in terms of what they can fight for,” added Brown. The harder workers are to replace, the more comfortable they have become demanding better working conditions. “It gave some structural leverage to workers in terms of their bargaining power,” said Eidlin. The result is not just walking off the job, but workers voting down contracts. “That’s definitely a big thing here in Canada,” said Eidlin. Workers at Metro, a major grocery store chain, rejected a contract in July, as did salt mine workers in Windsor, Ontario. “The contracts are not getting rejected because they are bad, but because they are not good enough,” said Eidlin. Even the recently ratified Ford autoworkers contract in Canada, which he said “was rightly viewed as one of the richest contracts” Unifor, the union, negotiated, received just 54 percent approval. Autoworkers embody the image of a union worker in the US. And they have historically, in particular with the United Auto Workers union, been at the forefront of labour gains. That diluted over the decades, culminating in a scandal that began to unravel in 2015, exposing gross levels of corruption in the UAW leadership, with union brass taking bribes, stealing union money and getting kickbacks in exchange for contract concessions. Fifteen members of UAW leadership were convicted on fraud and corruption charges, and went to prison, including two former presidents. In 2020, the UAW agreed to a referendum that changed the way the top leadership was elected, from a convention that had stifled the ability of workers to have their voices heard, to a direct system of voting. This opened the pathway for a harder-line group of union worker reformers in the US, known as the United All Workers for Democracy that had been organising on the sidelines to win seats in the executive – including the presidency, with Shawn Fain. “You wouldn’t have had this strike that you’re seeing right now” without them, said Eidlin. The result is a different kind of strike strategy. The union is using the element of surprise with targeted walkouts at certain plants giving themselves room to escalate, and also preserving their strike fund, so they can negotiate for longer, said Brown. “It is a strike that has the potential to put the UAW back in the driver’s seat for the entire labour movement,” said Eidlin. There are many, as was made clear by the duelling visits to autoworker ground zero by the most politically powerful men in the United States this week. Wearing a UAW ballcap and flanked by union bosses,President Joe Biden visited the picket linein Wayne County, Michigan on Tuesday, the first sitting president to do so “in modern times”, according to the White House. “Stick with it because you deserve the significant raise that you need and other benefits,” said President Biden, speaking through a bullhorn, as he noted the “sacrifices” that workers made in 2008, when the car companies were in trouble, and needed a $17.4bn government bailout. “Let’s get back what we lost.” Donald Trump, who amid legal scandals is still vying for a return to office in 2024, held a rally in a non-union factory in Michigan on Wednesday to court the working-class vote that helped propel him to the presidency in 2016. Trump has taken a combative approach with the unions, seeking to sow divisions between leadership and the rank and file by urging workers not to pay union dues, and claiming the union brass have “deals” going on. Under Biden, the National Labor Relations Board has been “more actively fulfilling its role” on behalf of workers, with new appointees who are reforming rules so that it is easier for workers to unionise, Brown said. But the Biden administration also intervened in a labour dispute involving railway workers last year, imposing a contract that averted a strike, and did not meet worker demands, such as paid sick leave. According to economists, it has been significant. One analysis published by the Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based organisation that follows labour strikes, pegged the total economic losses in the first week from the UAW strike at more than $1.6bn. The car industry represents 3 percent to 3.5 percent of the US gross domestic product, raising questions about wider economic spillover effects. Striking workers have also been cast by some observers as an impediment to environmental progress, noting that the strike might affect the rollout of electric vehicles, even though the UAW has repeatedly said it supports the green transition. In an editorial run in the Detroit Free Press last week, Mark Reuss, the president of GM, took aim at the “misinformation” he said was emanating from the union, and defended what he called an “historic” offer on the table that included a 20 percent wage rise across four years, that he said would ensure that 85 percent of current represented employees would earn a base wage of about $82,000 a year. He called the union’s demands “untenable” and dismissed claims that “record profits go toward fuelling corporate greed” as “a myth.” The union is seeking a 36 percent wage rise over four years. But both Brown and Eidlin say autoworkers are actually trying to dig themselves out of a financial hole that has been growing for years. “The economic cost of not striking is we have this economy that has not worked for most workers for the last 50 years,” said Eidlin. “What we have here is an effort to fix that damage.”"
‘All I saw were dead bod­ies’: Grief and anger af­ter Pak­istan bomb blasts,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/all-i-saw-were-dead-bodies-grief-and-anger-after-pakistan-bomb-blast,A sui­cide bomb at­tack tar­get­ing a re­li­gious pro­ces­sion in Balochis­tan’s Mas­tung has killed dozens and hurt many oth­ers.,"Quetta, Pakistan– On a cold Friday evening, dozens of people huddled outside Quetta Civil Hospital, their bodies heaving with sobs. Just hours earlier, asuicide bomb blasthad ripped through a religious gathering in Mastung, killing at least 52 people and wounding dozens of others. “All I saw were dead bodies and injured after the blast”, said Barakat Ali, a young man standing helplessly outside the hospital’s trauma centre where many of the wounded people had been rushed. His clothes were soaked in blood. “I cannot forget the hue and cry of the injured battling for their lives on the spot”, Ali told Al Jazeera, tears flowing down his face. Authorities say the attacker detonated himself in the middle of a crowd that had gathered near a mosque to take part in a procession celebrating the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad. “The suicide bomber blew himself up inside the procession to cause maximum damage”, a senior security official, who requested anonymity since they were not authorised to speak to the media, told Al Jazeera. Shortly after the explosion in Balochistan province, in southwestern Pakistan,another bombingwas carried out at a mosque in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in the country’s northwest. At least five people were killed in the second attack. No group has claimed responsibility for either attack. At the hospital in Quetta, the largest city of Balochistan, the survivors who narrowly escaped death were grappling with the aftermath of the attack. “Dust and storm, [that’s what] I saw when I stood”, said Saifullah, a young man possibly in his late 30s who lost a brother in the blast. Besides the grief, a sense of anger was also palpable. “We demand justice and the terrorists should be punished”, a woman cried. “Is this justice? I lost a young son,” she continued. Two other women wearing traditional Balochi dress were accompanying the devastated mother. “Why my son has been martyred, what was his sin?” she said, her voice cracking with emotion.  Some relatives of victims demanded that both the Balochistan government and the federal government provide better healthcare to the wounded. “Our loved ones are not getting proper treatment,” Maulana Abdul Rasool, a religious leader, complained. He said despite repeated requests, the hospital administration was not cooperative in providing better healthcare to those battling for their lives. Hospital spokesperson Waseem Baig said 51 people wounded in Mastung were receiving treatment there. Seven of them were in serious condition. Balochistan caretaker home minister, Zubair Jamali, visited the hospital and promised that those responsible for the attack would be held accountable. “This is unacceptable, we will bring the terrorists to book,” he said, adding that “terrorism” was a serious threat. “Really pained to witness the innocent people [covered] in blood”, Jamali added. Pakistan has seen a dramatic surge in armed attacks this year, with hundreds of such incidents recorded in recent months. Earlier this year, more than 100 people were killed in abomb blastat a mosque situated inside the police quarters in the northwestern city of Peshawar. "
Analy­sis: Can Su­dan’s civil­ian lead­ers save their coun­try from col­lapse?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/analysis-can-sudan-civilian-leaders-save-country-collapse,"Civil­ian forces were cen­tral to the move­ment that over­threw for­mer Pres­i­dent Omar al-Bashir, but are now mar­gin­alised.","Months into a ruinous war between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), many Sudanese people have been surprisingly less than welcoming about the re-emergence of the civilian coalition that was part of thecountry’s 2019 revolution. In July, one of the leaders of that civilian movement, former Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, appeared at a regional summit, after two years of absence from the political scene. Despite the war in the country, the re-emergence of figures like Hamdok and the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC) a coalition of parties, unions and civil society organisations that the former prime minister led a government with, is seen as opportunistic by many who still remember that the civilian coalition was overthrown in 2021. “The same faces that disappeared and were silent after the October coup are now lined up in front of foreign diplomats to present themselves as representatives of the Sudanese people,” said Qusai, a 28-year-old pharmacist living in Khartoum. Hamdok and the FFC, along with the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the RSF, were meant to guide Sudan to democratic governance after the2019 overthrowof former President Omar al-Bashir, and ostensibly, his old power structures. But the coalition could not keep itself together, the infighting splintering it to the point where the SAF and RSF were able to stage their own October 2019 coup and remove the civilians from power entirely. Out of power, observers say that the civilian groups have taken sides, aligning themselves with one of the other of the belligerents. The Democratic Bloc, an offshoot of the FFC, is said to have sided with the SAF, seemingly to push for its demands that more civilian groups be included in any settlement agreement struck in Sudan. The Democratic Bloc has its political weight, counting among its members factions of Sudan’s two biggest parties, the Reform and Renewal bloc of the Umma Party, and the Jaafar Mirghani-led bloc of the Democratic Unionist Party-Jaafar Mirghani. Also included were regional actors like the Beja Tribal Council from the east, as well as Darfur Governor Minni Minnawi’s Sudan Liberation Movement and Finance Minister Gibril Ibrahim’s Justice and Equality Movement, also from Darfur. On the other hand, the FFC-CC (Central Council), which emerged after the split with the Democratic Bloc, is accused of having fallen for the ploys of RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo, who,at least in public, has called for a transitional civilian-led government, hoping to win the favour of such a government, if it comes to pass. “The FFC-CC denies that they have any sort of political alliance with the RSF, but through their actions, statements and dealings we can deduce the existence of their relationship,” Mohanad Elbalal, a British Sudanese observer and commentator on Sudanese politics, told Al Jazeera. Elbalal also pointed to FFC-CC and the RSF’s shared hostility toward the deposed political Islamists of al-Bashir’s National Congress Party (NCP), as well as their shared talking points during the post-2021 coup negotiations and after the outbreak of the war. “The FFC[-CC] provided political cover [for the RSF] claiming that Islamists were behind this [war], and lobbying the international community that an army victory would see a return of the [al-Bashir] regime overthrown in 2019,” Elbalal said. In addition, both are against the inclusion of any other political groups – including the Democratic Bloc – in the approval and implementation of a framework agreement. The agreement, a December 2022 deal between the civilian politicians and the generals, had, for a short while, seemed like hope for Sudan’s future. “The FFC[-CC] wanted to be able to appoint the majority of government ministers,” Elbalal added, referring to statements by Babiker Faisal, a prominent FFC-CC member, days before the war, that the bloc was not open to any changes to the framework agreement. Sudan’s civil movement was at the heart of one of the most significant events in the country’s modern history – the 2019 overthrow of al-Bashir. The FFC had formed in 2018, as discontent built, and was a main mover behind the protests triggered by a deteriorating economy and rising prices. After al-Bashir’s fall, it made an initial power-sharing agreement with the SAF and the RSF in August 2019. Then the October 2021 coup happened, and the leadership was plunged into negotiations to end the military’s rule, leading to the framework agreement. However, the deal said that the RSF would be absorbed into the SAF – leading to a dispute between army head General Abdel-Fattah al-Burhan and Hemedti as the SAF pressed for a two-year integration while the RSF pushed for a 10-year window. The breakdown in negotiations that followed, and the ensuing beginning of the conflict, led to accusations being thrown back and forth between the civilian groups “The parties who were not part of the framework agreement blame those in support of the agreement as being responsible for the current situation,” said Nagi Musa, a civil society activist and founding member of Girifna, a movement that rose up against al-Bashir. The FFC-CC’s decision to sign the framework agreement is still backed by some, who see it as an attempt to avoid bloodshed. “[The FFC-CC] saw that the presence of the RSF was a threat to Sudan’s future,” added Wael Aldabi, a mechanical engineer from Khartoum. “It therefore insisted on signing the framework agreement to unify the armed forces through a process of negotiation rather than by force – the way that it is happening right now.” But others see it as evidence of a silent and continued support for the RSF, in the hope of securing a political future in case the RSF survives the war. Mohammad Saad, a political observer and journalist who recently left Khartoum for Cairo, said: “None of the other parties within the Central Council have enough popular support to win elections and secure the political influence they would gain through their participation in the framework agreement and their alliance with Hemedti. They may still see him as their golden ticket to power and are careful not to denounce the RSF’s actions”. The FFC-CC’s supposed ties to Hemedti have been problematic for it since the outbreak of the war, particularly as the RSF finds itself accused of morehuman rights violations, including attacks on civilians. In Khartoum, the RSF has been accused of engaging in a campaign of rape, looting and commandeering of civilian homes, and in Darfur, mass graves have been found, allegedly of victims of the RSF. One neighbourhood resistance committee member in Khartoum, who did not wish to be named, said that “almost all of the violations recorded by us in our neighbourhood involved individuals in RSF uniform”. But Yasir Arman, one of the FFC-CC’s leading figures, penned an article after the outbreak of war distancing the body from the RSF, writing that the coalition had an ongoing neutral stance in the conflict and that all hostilities must end. Al-Tayeb al-Abbasi, secretary-general of the Sudanese Lawyers Union and a member of the FFC-CC, told Al Jazeera from Cairo that “neutrality is not a sign of support for the RSF”. “To support any side in the conflict is to prefer more death and destruction,” al-Abbasi added. “The priority should be to stop the war and preserve what’s left of the institutions of the state.” That view was backed by Khalafallah Bushara, a Sudanese doctor living in the United States, who is optimistic that Sudan’s civilian leadership, including the FFC-CC, can help end the war by “putting pressure on foreign nations to apply sanctions [against the warring parties] and hold violators of international humanitarian laws accountable for their actions”. Despite the denials, according to Alex de Waal, an expert on Sudanese and African Politics and Executive Director of the World Peace Foundation, the FFC-CC’s post-war stance has undermined its reputation among the Sudanese public. “The RSF’s problem is that its military advances have become political defeats because of the atrocious way its soldiers treat civilians,” de Waal explained. “I don’t think it can recover from the reputational setback, and FFC-CC wasn’t quick enough to distance itself from the RSF to escape the fallout.” As the conflict continues, it is growing increasingly apparent that there is no easy way out of the predicament Sudan finds itself in. “People need to come to terms with the reality of complete state collapse,” Ahmed Kodouda, who served as a policy adviser in the post-revolution transitional government, told Al Jazeera. Kodouda also believes that, while Sudan’s civilian politicians have often come up with ideas for solutions to the country’s conflicts, in reality, they have only led to more indecision and practical delays on the ground. Some observers do think that civilian leaders are trying to do what they can, even if they have failed so far to find an effective means to rescue Sudan from its current situation. “The political parties are done for and the door is open for civilian forces to appear in a new form,” Nasreldin Elmahdi, former Vice-President of the National Umma Party and a former co-deputy chairman of the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF), said. Elmahdi left Sudan a few weeks after the outbreak of the war and is now working with Sudanese activists in Europe through the newly-formed Civil Conglomeration for Peace and Development. He envisions that the organisation can leverage its location in Europe to document human rights violations in Sudan and forward its findings to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for investigations and prospective prosecutions. More recently, Sudan’s political parties are continuing their efforts to stop the war through the formation of broader coalitions. The Popular Congress Party, the political Islamist party founded by the late Hassan al-Turabi in 1999 after a fallout with al-Bashir, recently called for a national dialogue bringing together all of the country’s power brokers in Port Sudan. The Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-North) also called for an anti-war coalition that would encompass Sudan’s broad political spectrum. Following suit, the FFC-CC and the Democratic Bloc held separate conferences in Cairo in late July in which they both made similar appeals to form broader civilian coalitions to put an end to the fighting and restore a transition to civilian-led rule. “There has been a lot of talk about forming united anti-war coalitions since the war started, but nothing has come of it and nothing will come of it because these initiatives lack coordination and the different coalitions are still sticking to their pre-war positions and alliances,” Saad commented. Al-Abbasi, who is also one of the founding members of the Sudanese Professionals’ Association (SPA), an umbrella group representing several trade unions that spearheaded the popular protests that led to the demise of the al-Bashir government, is also pessimistic about the state of Sudan’s political parties. “Their divisions contributed to the weakening of the revolution, and led to the current state of affairs,” he said. Instead, al-Abbasi believes that one of the last hopes for Sudan’s rescue is through civil society groups and professional unions, given that civil society organisations and some unions have remained non-partisan and independent bastions of civilian power. “The involvement of union members in politics caused serious rifts in the Sudanese Professionals’ Association,” al-Abbasi said. “We don’t want this mistake to repeat itself,” al-Abbasi said. While the FFC once symbolised hope for a democratic transition in Sudan, its gradual fragmentation reflects a concerning trend – the strengthening of armed actors and the weakening ability of the civilian bloc to shape Sudan’s political present and future. “[All] political parties in Sudan need to rebrand themselves,” Kodouda said. “ They need to improve their image in front of the Sudanese people and Sudan needs to find a new model and new way in which it can exist.”"
"US au­towork­ers ex­pand­ing strike at Ford, Gen­er­al Mo­tors",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/us-autoworkers-expanding-strike-at-ford-general-motors,"Union leader says 7,000 more work­ers will join strike as talks with US auto gi­ants fail to make ‘mean­ing­ful progress’.","United States autoworkers are expandingtheir two-week striketo additional locations, with the head of a major union saying 7,000 more workers will join the picket lines as labour talks have failed to advance significantly. United Auto Workers (UAW) President Shawn Fain said in a video appearance on Friday that negotiations have not broken down but Ford and General Motors “have refused to make meaningful progress”. The strike will expand to Ford’s Chicago assembly plant and GM’s assembly plant in Lansing, Michigan, at midday on Friday, said Fain, bringing the total number of workers on the picket lines to 25,000. The strike will not include any additional members at Jeep maker Stellantis. “Sadly, despite our willingness to bargain, Ford and GM have refused to make meaningful progress at the table,” Fain said. “Let’s stand up and win this thing – for ourselves, for our families, for our communities, for our country and for our future,” the UAW president added.  The union launched the partial, coordinated strike earlier this month, with thousands of workers across 20 states walking off the job to push for wage increases, shorter hours and improved retirement benefits. The work stoppage has drawn national attention, with US President Joe Biden and his Republican predecessor and likely 2024 election challenger Donald Trump both travelling to Michigan this week to show support for the striking workers. Speaking from a picket lineoutside an auto plant west of Detroit on Tuesday, Biden called for a “significant raise” for the employees. “You made a lot of sacrifices, gave up a lot, and the companies were in trouble,” the Democratic president said, referring to the 2008 financial crisis when US car manufacturers were on the verge of bankruptcy. “Now they’re doing incredibly well. And guess what? You should be doing incredibly well.” The UAW is expected to continue work stoppages currently under way until a new contract is ratified, a source familiar with the situation, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Reuters news agency. Automakers say the union’s demands would hurt their profits as they try to compete with non-union manufacturers such as Tesla.  The companies’last known wage offers were around 20 percent over the life of a four-year contract, a little more than half of what the union has demanded. Other contract improvements, such as cost of living increases, restoration of defined benefit pensions for newly hired workers, and an end to tiers of wages within the union are also on the table. Progress was reported in talks on Thursday night, especially with Stellantis. On Friday, Ford CEO Jim Farley said he felt his company could reach a compromise on pay and benefits with the unions. But he accused the UAW of “holding the deal hostage” over Ford’s use of outside companies — with non-union workers — to build batteries for electric vehicles, or EVs. About 18,300 UAW members at the Detroit Three are currently on strike, or about 12 percent of the 146,000 union members working at the automakers. Strikers have been getting $500 a week from the UAW’s strike fund. “To be clear, negotiations haven’t broken down. We’re still talking with all three companies and I’m still very hopeful that we can reach a deal,” said Fain, the union president. “We are fed up with corporate greed and we are fed up with corporate excess. We are fed up with breaking our bodies for companies that take more and more and give less and less.”"
‘Iraqis love life’: In con­ver­sa­tion with Ala Ta­l­a­bani,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/iraqis-love-life-in-conversation-with-ala-talabani,"On the side­lines of a con­fer­ence about Iraq, the par­lia­men­tar­i­an spoke to Al Jazeera about the coun­try’s fu­ture.","Doha, Qatar– Twenty years after the invasion of Iraq, the Iraqi people are still dealing with the fallout from Saddam Hussein’s rule and the years of unrest since it ended in 2003. At the same time, the international community is grappling with the question of whether the intervention that took place was the right way to go. In spite of all that, Ala Talabani told Al Jazeera, the Iraqi people love life and are excited about connecting with their “brothers and friends” in the Arab world and beyond. The Iraqi, Kurdish, Sufi politician heads the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan bloc in the Iraqi parliament and is continuing the work she began as a member of parliament 16 years ago. With a strong focus on women, youth and changing how business has been done for the past 20 years, Talabani is looking at whether there is a new way forward for the country along with a number of other Iraqi officials who attended a conference on lessons learned and the future of Iraq held by Georgetown University in Doha. She was part of a team that wrote a 2023-2030 strategy for Iraqi women – approved by the cabinet – that will require all ministries to set aside a portion of their budgets and capacity for programmes benefitting women. As the implementation of this strategy begins, Talabani is hopeful that Iraqi women will reach great heights, but she is also aware that it will not be easy. “Women are fought, no matter who they are. There is jealousy sometimes, and sometimes people just fight them. It’s this patriarchal thinking of ‘Oh, there’s a woman and she’s excelled and exceeded me. How did she surpass me?'” Iraqi women today, she said, need awareness of their rights and laws that protect these rights. “Women [who lack education] must be [made] confident through education for certain sectors and … for women who are educated … through a spirit of defiance that will allow her to overcome the obstacles society puts in front of her. “For woman in rural areas – who are usually not educated and are persecuted often, if we’re honest about it – we need them to be educated, to know what their rights are so that they can stand up and say: ‘No, these are my rights.'” Illiteracy is still an issue in Iraq, especially in rural areas, and twice as many women as men are illiterate. With regards to legislation that protects women’s rights, Talabani said implementation has to follow passage of such laws. “Women sit in the Iraqi parliament today through laws, through the creation of a quota for female representatives. That is what made all parties and political blocs nominate female candidates; otherwise, this would not have happened in my opinion.” As the first female head of a political bloc in parliament, Talabani has had firsthand experience with this issue. Whenever possible, she would nominate female politicians to sit on committees formed to address national issues. However, she noted, other blocs and parties nominated only men, even though they had many capable women in their party. When she asked a male politician why his bloc did not nominate female parliamentarians for the committees, his response was: “I don’t have any.” “They meant they didn’t have women in their groupings capable enough to sit on fact-finding committees. When I pointed out that they had several capable women, they said: ‘They’re not like you.’ “So we exist but as scattered individuals. One capable woman here, a politician there, a successful minister, a Yazidi victim, a woman IDP [internally displaced person] displaced by terrorism, … but to see a woman and a man on an equal footing, to truly believe that there is no difference, we need to change society’s view to understand that a woman can be a lot of things – as a person.”  One of the biggest questions in Iraq today is the revision of the constitution written in 2005, two years after Saddam Hussein was overthrown, and Talabani says a deep review of Iraq’s governance is due. “I support rewriting the constitution. When we wrote it, we were very committed to it. It was the ‘mother law’ that all other laws came after. But there were implementation problems,” she said. Politicians turned to the Federal Supreme Court to interpret certain clauses, like the ones regulating the relationship between Baghdad and Erbil, the capital of the semiautonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq, or how many votes a presidential candidate needs in a second round of voting. “Unfortunately, some of the clauses were interpreted according to the prevailing political climate at the time, and that’s not right,” Talabani said, going on to outline how various groups, fearing a return of past persecution, negotiated power-sharing with those fears foremost in their minds, trying to secure as many rights as possible. The prevailing political climate has changed after the turbulence of the past 20 years, she added. “You have Shia groups who suffered persecution for so long. They wanted a constitution to guarantee that this despotism would never return, so they argued against the centralisation of power, that there should be many federated provinces formed, like Kurdistan. Sunni politicians at the time were against this idea, fearing that it would splinter Iraq.” Power had been concentrated in the hands of minority Sunnis under Saddam Hussein, but the tables have since turned. The Shia blocs, Talabani explained, now want a more centralised system while Sunni groups are asking that Anbar, a majority Sunni province in western Iraq, be allowed self-government in the same vein as the Kurdish region in the north. They are seeking decentralisation now because they feel they are being sidelined since ISIL’s (ISIS’s) rise and fall. “We need to look into the things that affect the running of the country, that impact relations between the centre and provinces … in a way that works after 20 years of implementing – and often violating – the constitution.” Iraq’s economy has difficulty creating enough jobs for its youth, causing resentment and endangering plans for an economic recovery. Most families want their children to attend university and study “classic” majors that qualify them for jobs like doctors, lawyers and engineers, preferably in the public sector where jobs are secure and pensioned. But this results in a glut of trained graduates that any public service would have a hard time absorbing. A democracy-building organisation Talabani heads, Leilan, is working with Iraqi youth to “encourage them to set up small projects. Because we have unemployment, … it’s difficult to try to make it so all youth can get jobs in the public service. “And really, [the public service] is ‘masked unemployment’, putting people in state institutions, when we have so many already.[The youth] have great ideas, but they need training, … how to enter the market, how to access loans from banks.” A recently approved 2023-2025 government budget has set aside large sums to create jobs in the public sector, but, Talabani argues, they will not be productive and will not develop competitive skills. Proudly wearing an ensemble made by a designer who started her own small atelier, Talabani said developing real-world skills for youth is more effective because it allows private sector growth that eventually provides real employment. University graduates who choose the “classic” majors often find themselves moving into business anyway, Talabani added, which means that majors like IT or business administration make a lot more sense. “A lot of the youth we train are either done with or finishing up in ‘familiar’ majors, and we help them redirect. For example, there’s a dentist we supported to set up her own business making illuminated advertising panels.” Ideally, there would also be a lot more attention and support for training to enlarge the number of nurses, technicians, builders and more, which would expand society’s concept of what an acceptable job is, she said.  “Foreign interference in Iraq, Turkish shelling, Iranian shelling, other external interference, … we don’t have one vision or one unified way of addressing the outside world. Who draws up Iraq’s foreign policy? “The next wars will be over water for Arab countries and especially Iraq. We have a lot of climate challenges, and I’m not sure if the policies we currently have under the Ministry of Environment will be sufficient. Iraq faces desertification; which is costing thousands of jobs and livelihoods in areas like the marshes. Iraq’s severe water shortages have led to talks with Turkey to request that its dams on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which start there and run through Iraq, be opened up to release more water for Iraq. Turkey,  in turn, is negotiating with Iraq over the presence of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, an armed group also known as the PKK, in areas close to the border the two countries share. Another issue between Iraq and Turkey is petroleum exports from the Kurdish region to Turkey, which had bypassed Baghdad until they were stopped when Baghdad went to international arbitration and won. “All these things are on the negotiating table right now,” Talabani continued. “In my opinion, part of it is political but part of it is interests and can be sorted out. I think it was an important step on the part of the current prime minister to launch the Development Road project, which will benefit Turkey.” “It links the port of Faw to Turkey to move goods and people from the East through to Turkey and Europe, a sort of replacement for the Silk Road. Turkey will benefit because this huge transport artery will allow Turkish companies and ministries to enter the Iraqi market easily – and it will make solving the water crisis easier, in my view. “We can’t keep threatening and complaining that Turkey is not giving us enough water. We need to talk about mutual interests, and that is how things can be solved with Turkey and with other countries.” "
Im­pris­oned Tunisian op­po­si­tion leader Ghan­nouchi starts hunger strike,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/imprisoned-tunisian-opposition-leader-ghannouchi-starts-hunger-strike,The 82-year-old op­po­si­tion leader has been in jail since last April on charges of in­cite­ment against Kais Saied’s rule.,"Rached Ghannouchi, a prominent opposition leader in Tunisia and the former speaker of the country’s parliament, has begun a three-day hunger strike behind bars, in solidarity with a fellow political prisoner and head of the opposition coalition National Salvation Front, Jaouher Ben Mbarek. Ghannounchi has been imprisoned since last April on charges of incitement and plotting against state security, which the opposition figure and his supporters say are baseless. He is a fierce critic of President Kais Saied. The president has been accused by the opposition of increasing authoritarianism and staging a coup when he dissolved parliament and dismissed the government in July 2021, governing by decree since. The 82-year-old Ghannouchi, who is the head of Tunisia’s self-described “Muslim Democrat” Ennahdha party, was parliament speaker from the 2019 election until Saied sent tanks to shut down the chamber in 2021. He wassentencedin absentia to one year in prison in May, as he refused to appear before the judiciary, rejecting what he said were fabricated political trials.  A statement by Ennahdha on Friday said Ghannounchi has begun a hunger strike demanding the release of all political prisoners and “ending the injustice against them”. The statement expressed its solidarity with Ghannounchi and Jaouher Ben Mbarek, the head of the opposition coalition National Salvation Front, who began his own hunger strike four days ago, and held the authorities responsible for “any harm caused to the health and safety of the prisoners on hunger strike”. It also said that most of the political prisoners have been imprisoned by the “coup authorities” without trial or interrogated in “fabricated cases whose only motive is to eliminate political rivals who oppose it”. Ben Mbarek has spent more than seven months in pre-trial detention, his lawyer Dalila Msaddek said. His hunger strike is in protest of the “judicial farce led by the investigative judge at the antiterrorism division”, Msaddek said in a Facebook post. Police have arrested more than20 political figuresthis year, including Ghannouchi, accusing some of plotting against state security. Among the arrested are lawyers, businessmen, and the head of a popular radio station known for giving a platform to criticism of the president. Ghannouchi’s lawyer said the charges against him stem from a funeral eulogy he gave last year for a member of his Ennahdha party when he said the deceased “did not fear a ruler or tyrant [and] only feared God”. ‘Free Ghannouchi’ an online campaign calling for the release of the opposition leader, also released a statement on Friday holding Saied “fully responsible for the consequences of the strike on the health of… Ghannouchi”. “Going on hunger strike for the sake of freedom and dignity for all political prisoners is not a novelty for Rached Ghannouchi, who has spent more than four decades struggling for freedom, justice and other noble human values,” the statement added. Ghannouchi’s career as a leading politician was also referenced by Monica Marks, a professor of Middle East Politics at NYU Abu Dhabi, and a leading expert on Tunisia. “Scholars are hard-pressed to name an Arab thinker who has argued more passionately for Islam’s compatibility [with] democracy than Rached Ghannouchi,” Marks wrote on social media. Saied, who enshrined his new powers in a constitution that passed through acontroversial referendumwith low turnout last year, has denied his actions were a coup and said they were needed to save Tunisia from years of chaos. He has called his critics criminals, traitors and “terrorists” and warned that any judge who freed them would be considered abetting them. Prior to the 2011 uprising that removed former longtime leader Zine El Abidine Ben Ali from power, Ghannouchi spent more than 20 years in exile in the British capital London. He returned to Tunisia in January 2011 to a triumphant welcome, and in October of that year, Ennhadha won 37 percent of the vote in the parliamentary elections – the largest party win. The party repeatedly performed strongly in elections until Saied’s 2021 power-grab, and has since boycotted elections, along with the majority of the country’s opposition. "
What is a US gov­ern­ment shut­down and who will be af­fect­ed?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/what-is-a-us-government-shutdown-and-who-will-be-affected,Al Jazeera breaks down the wide-reach­ing ef­fects of a fed­er­al gov­ern­ment shut­down as Oc­to­ber 1 fund­ing dead­line looms.,"Legislators in the United States have little time left to avert afederal government shutdown, as a group of hardline Republicans has refused to support must-pass funding legislation unless massive spending cuts are made. The hard-right Republicans in the House of Representatives – many of whom are allies of former President Donald Trump – on Friday voted down a bipartisan stopgap spending bill meant to give lawmakers more time to negotiate a full-year deal. Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy had been trying to get the right flank of his party to support the measure before a midnight deadline on Saturday (04:00 GMT on Sunday). “It’s not the end yet, I’ve got other ideas,” McCarthy told reporters following the Friday afternoon defeat. But if McCarthy turns to Democrats for help, the hardline Republicans would have a way toremove him as speaker. In the meantime, the country is staring down a possible government shutdown – the fourth in a decade – that would see hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed, among other wide-reaching effects. Here’s all you need to know about what a federal government shutdown means and who will be affected.  A government shutdown happens when Congress does not approve discretionary spending for the upcoming fiscal year, which begins on October 1. A shutdown affects nearly every corner of the US government, from the delivery of welfare cheques and publishing of national economic data to the operation of federal courts, museums and national parks. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers likely would be furloughed – temporarily forced to leave work without pay – while workers deemed essential would remain on the job but continue without a paycheque. During the last shutdown, about 800,000 workers were furloughed, USA Today reported. “This time around, the ripple effect may extend even further, resulting in an even larger number of furloughed workers,” the outlet said. This includes workers across federal government agencies, including the Department of Defense, as well as members of the US military. “All of this would prove disruptive to our national security,” the White Housewarnedthis week. John Hubert, an airport security officer in Florida who has worked at the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for 21 years, said federal workers are “continuously put on the chopping block”. “It’s ridiculous,” Hubert told The Associated Press. “We should not be put in this position every single year, then used as a bargaining chip to get legislation passed.” A handful of federal programmes that millions of people across the US rely on every day could also be disrupted — from dwindling funds for food assistance to potential delays in customer service for recipients of Medicare and Social Security. The ripple effects would come down to how long the shutdown lasts and varying contingency plans in place at affected agencies. “Collectively, hundreds of millions of Americans, a majority of the population, are receiving some kind of benefits from the government,” said Forrest V Morgeson III, an associate professor at Michigan State University’s Broad College of Business. For example, nearly seven millionwomen and childrenwho rely on the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) could be at risk of losing assistance almost immediately into a shutdown, according to the Biden administration. That’s because the federal contingency fund supporting normal WIC operations will likely run out in a matter of days — pushing states to rely on their own money or carryover funds. Impacted families are “going to be going to food pantries”, said Dr Nancy Nielsen, senior associate dean for health policy at the University at Buffalo’s Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. “These are people who need the help. These are moms. These are infants. So this is a real problem.” Head Start programmes serving more than 10,000 disadvantaged children would immediately lose federal funding, although they might be able to stave off immediate closure if the shutdown doesn’t last long. US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said a shutdown would stop progress made to address air travel disruptions over the past year. “We have finally seen cancellations and delays get back down to normal levels,” he said this week. It also would force the government to “immediately have to stop training new air traffic controllers and furlough another 1,000 controllers who are already in the training pipeline”, Buttigieg said. The processing of passports and visas will continue in a shutdown “as the situation permits”, according to guidance that the State Department gave employees last week. The department said consulates in the US and abroad will stay open “as long as there are sufficient fees to support operations”, but passport work could stop if the building where the work is done gets shuttered.  Credit agencies have warned that brinkmanship and political polarisation are harming the US financial outlook. Moody’s, the last major rating agency to rate the US government “Aaa” with a stable outlook,said on Mondaythat a shutdown would harm the country’s credit rating. A lower credit rating means the country may seem less creditworthy and may have to pay higher interest rates on its debt. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Friday that a government shutdown would “undermine” the country’s economic progress by idling key programmes, including for small businesses, and could delay major infrastructure improvements."
Tragedy strikes Iraq af­ter fire at a wed­ding,https://www.aljazeera.com/podcasts/2023/9/29/tragedy-strikes-iraq-after-fire-at-a-wedding,A fire broke out at a Chris­t­ian wed­ding in Iraq killing over 100 peo­ple in a com­mu­ni­ty that has suf­fered un­der ISIL.," A fire broke out during a wedding in Nineveh governorate, Northern Iraq, in Hamdaniya’s Christian community. Within hours, the death toll had risen above 100 people, and over 150 have been injured. Fire extinguishing and rescue operations began soon after the blaze erupted, with victims being transferred to hospitals nationwide to be treated. Authorities expect the death toll to continue rising. Could this latest fire in Iraq have been prevented? And what does it mean for a community that’s only now returning from years of devastation?

Wife of de­posed Gabonese pres­i­dent ar­rest­ed for ‘mon­ey laun­der­ing’,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/wife-of-deposed-gabonese-president-arrested-for-money-laundering,Sylvia Bon­go Valentin has been un­der house ar­rest in the cap­i­tal since her hus­band was over­thrown in an Au­gust 30 coup.,"The wife of Gabon’s deposed President Ali Bongo Ondimba has been charged with “money laundering” and other offences, the public prosecutor said Friday, a month after a coup toppled her husband. Sylvia Bongo Valentin has been under house arrest in the capital since her husband was overthrown on August 30, moments after being proclaimed the winner in a presidential election. Her eldest son, Noureddin Bongo Valentin, has already been charged with corruption. The former first lady was charged by an investigating judge on Thursday, prosecutor Andre Patrick Roponat announced on state TV channels on Friday. Her house arrest order has also been upheld, Roponat said. One of her lawyers said earlier this month that she was being kept “incommunicado outside any legal framework”. The Bongos’ son, Noureddin, has already been charged with corruption and embezzling public funds with several former cabinet members and two ex-ministers. Ali Bongo took over when his father Omar died in 2009 after nearly 42 years in power. Now 64, Bongo ruled the country until his overthrow this August after the presidential election. The election result was branded a fraud by the opposition and the military coup leaders, who have also accused his government of widespread corruption and bad governance."
"Di­anne Fe­in­stein, vet­er­an US sen­a­tor and top De­mo­c­rat, dies aged 90",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/us-senator-dianne-feinstein-dies-at-90,"Trib­utes pour in from US law­mak­ers af­ter news of the death of Fe­in­stein, the longest-serv­ing woman in the US Sen­ate.","Washington, DC –Dianne Feinstein, the longest-serving woman in the United States Senate, has died at age 90, US media outlets reported. The cause of death was not immediately clear. The Associated Press and other news outlets reported that Feinstein died on Friday, citing unidentified sources. The California lawmaker, who was the oldest member of the Senate, had suffered mounting health problems, including a battle with shingles. Often described by supporters as a trailblazer in US politics, Feinstein hadsaid earlier this yearthat she would not seek re-election in 2024. “This is a sad day for California and the nation. [Senator] Feinstein was a champion for our state, and served as the voice of a political revolution for women,” California Congresswoman Barbara Lee said on social media on Friday.  Feinstein was elected in 1992 as the first woman to represent California in the US Senate and quickly rose to become a key figure in the Democratic Party, playing prominent roles on committees and passing key legislation. In 2014, her office led efforts torelease a reportthat detailed a torture programme run by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that saw individuals detained across the world in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. But the senator’s career had been derailed in recent years byhealth issues. That included reports that she suffered from short-term memory loss, spurringclaimsthat she may be mentally unfit to serve. Still, Feinstein, who faced calls to step down in recent months, consistently defended herself as an effective legislator. “Even with a divided Congress, we can still pass bills that will improve lives. Each of us was sent here to solve problems,” she said in a statement in February announcing her decision not to run again next year. “That’s what I’ve done for the last 30 years, and that’s what I plan to do for the next two years,” she said, pledging to finish her term in office. “My thanks to the people of California for allowing me to serve them.” Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairman Jaime Harrison said on Friday that he was “heartbroken” by Feinstein’s death. “She was a force for good and a titan of American politics,” he wrote in a social media post. President Joe Biden, who served alongside Feinstein in the Senate for 15 years, described her as a “pioneering American” who was sharp, “tough”, and loyal. “Dianne made her mark on everything from national security to the environment to protecting civil liberties. She’s made history in so many ways, and our country will benefit from her legacy for generations,” Biden said in a statement.  Al Jazeera’s Patty Culhane, reporting from Washington, DC, said Feinstein has left behind “quite a legacy”. She was the first woman to serve as head of the Senate Intelligence Committee “and it’s hard to overstate just how important that position is”, Culhane said. The senator faced criticism from some progressives over the years, including for supporting the 2003 USinvasion of Iraq. But in a major legislative achievement, Feinstein authored a bill that banned assault weapons in the US in 1994. The ban expired in 2004, but Democrats have been calling for it to be renewed amid frequentmass shootings. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, a vocal advocate of gun control, heaped praise on Feinstein on Friday. “The modern anti-gun violence movement, now stronger thanthe gun lobby, would not exist but for Dianne,” he wrote on social media. Many Republicans also lauded the late senator. Chuck Grassley, a key Republican who is now the oldest senator at age 90, said he had a “wonderful working relationship” with Feinstein when they served on various committees. “Feinstein did an outstanding job representing the [people] of California,” he wrote. Feinstein’s death will affect next year’s race to replace her in the Senate, as California Governor Gavin Newsom now needs to appoint someone to fill the vacancy until Feinstein’s term ends in January 2025. The appointee would have a major advantage as an incumbent in next year’s election. Lee, the California congresswoman, along with fellow Democratic House members Katie Porter and Adam Schiff are vying for the seat. Newsom has already appointed California’s other senator – Alex Padilla – to replaceKamala Harris, who vacated the seat in 2021 to serve as Biden’s vice president. The governor had previously said that he would tap a Black woman to succeed Feinstein should she fail to finish her term. "
IOC al­lows Paris Olympics par­tic­i­pants to wear hi­jabs at ath­letes’ vil­lage,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/ioc-allows-paris-olympics-participants-to-wear-hijab-at-athletes-village,French ath­letes are still sub­ject to a head­scarf ban as their sports fed­er­a­tion re­stricts the hi­jab dur­ing the games.,"The International Olympic Committee has ruled that participants in the Paris 2024 Olympic Games are free to wear a headscarf known as a hijab in the athletes’ village, just days after France’s sports minister barred it for the host country’s athletes. Although the IOC on Friday removed hijab restrictions in the athletes’ village, French athletes are still subject to the rules of their sports federation and are not allowed to wear hijabs during the games. A spokesperson for the Olympic body said it was in contact with the French Olympic Committee (CNOSF) to better understand the situation with the French athletes. “For the Olympic Village, the IOC rules apply,” an IOC spokesperson said to Reuters news agency. “There are no restrictions on wearing the hijab or any other religious or cultural attire.” The Olympic Village becomes home to most of the 10,000 athletes who attend Olympic Games, where they share common spaces such as dining halls and recreational facilities. The sports competitions at the Olympics are organised and overseen by the individual international sports federations. On Sunday, French Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera announced that the country’s athletes would be barred from wearing hijabs during the Paris Games to respect principles of secularism. She told France 3 television that the government was opposed to the display of religious symbols during sporting events to ensure “absolute neutrality in public services”. France has protected its strict form of secularism with laws that have cracked down on its Muslim community. In August, France announced that it wasbanning the abayain schools. Dozens of girls were alsosent homewhen they wore it to school. In January last year, French senators voted to ban hijabsin sportscompetitions and in July this year, a top French court upheld a hijab banduring footballcompetitions. Hijab-wearing French footballers have been fighting for inclusivity on the pitch through a collective called “Les Hijabeuses.” Despite being home to one of Europe’s largest Muslim minorities, France is theonly countryon the continent that excludes hijab-wearing athletes in most domestic sports competitions. Muslim associations and human rights groups have alleged that France has chipped away at democratic protections and left Muslims vulnerable to abuse with such laws. The United Nations human rights office also criticised the French decision to bar its athletes from wearing hijabs. “No one should impose on a woman what she needs to wear or not wear,” United Nations rights office spokesperson Marta Hurtado told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday. In 2016, Ibtihaj Muhammadmade historyby becoming the first United States team member to compete in the Olympics while wearing a hijab. "
‘Bold step’: Philip­pines vows to re­move fu­ture South Chi­na Sea bar­ri­ers,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/philippines-promises-to-remove-future-barriers-at-disputed-reef,Com­ments come af­ter coast­guard dis­man­tled a Chi­nese buoy bar­ri­er set up on a dis­put­ed shoal that raised ten­sions.,"The Philippine coastguard has promised to “do whatever it takes” to remove any more floating barriers installed by China at a disputed reef in the South China Sea. Friday’s remarks come after an aerial inspection of Scarborough Shoal on Thursday confirmed a 300-metre (984-foot) barrier that ignited the latest diplomatic row between Beijing and Manila had beentaken away. The floating barrier was found across the entrance to the shoal last week during a routine Philippine government resupply mission to Filipino fisherfolk. In a special operation ordered by President Ferdinand Marcos, Philippine Coast Guard personnel cut a rope tethering the barrier to an anchor, allowing it to drift. “In the next coming months, if ever that barrier will once again be in place, the Philippine Coast Guard will do whatever it takes for us to remove the barrier,” spokesperson Jay Tarriela told reporters as he sat next to the anchor seized during the mission. In his first public remarks on the incident, Marcos said on Friday his government was “not looking for trouble”. But he insisted it would “continue to defend the Philippines, the maritime territory of the Philippines, the rights of our fishermen to ply their trade in the areas where they have been fishing for hundreds of years”.  After the Philippine coastguard dismantled the barrier at the mouth of Scarborough Shoal, Philippine fishing boats entered the shallow lagoon and caught about 164 tonnes of fish in one day, Marcos said. “That’s what our fishermen lose so there should not be a barrier there, and it’s clear the area is within the Philippines,” he said. “Our fishermen have been fishing in those areas for hundreds of years so I can’t understand why that has changed.” Earlier this week,China warned the Philippinesnot to “stir up trouble” over the incident that ignited a war of words between the countries. China’s coastguard said on Wednesday it deployed the line of buoys after the Philippine vessel’s “intrusion into the lagoon”. China, which claims almost the entire South China Sea, seized Scarborough Shoal from the Philippines in 2012. Since then,Beijing deployed patrol boatsthat Manila says harass Philippine vessels. During Thursday’s aerial surveillance, officials identified three Chinese coastguard ships, including two inside the reef, which issued six radio challenges to the aircraft. A fourth vessel was described as a “militia” boat. A small number of Philippine fishing boats was also spotted outside the turquoise waters of the shoal. A senior US Defense Department official on Thursday praised the Philippines’ actions to remove the barrier as a “bold step”, and said the United States stood by its security commitments to the country. “The department has been incredibly clear that when it comes to our treaty commitments to the Philippines, we believe an armed attack against Philippine Armed Forces, public vessels, aircraft, apply to the South China Sea. That includes the Philippine Coast Guard,” Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for South and Southeast Asia Lindsey Ford told a congressional hearing."
Qatar me­di­ates open­ing of Gaza-Is­rael cross­ing as protests end,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/qatar-mediates-opening-of-gaza-israel-crossing-as-protests-end,"Bor­der opened af­ter demon­stra­tions by Pales­tin­ian work­ers with an in­for­mal agree­ment Qatar helped me­di­ate, en­voy says.","Qatar says it successfully mediated an agreement between Israel and officials in the Gaza Strip to reopen crossing points to the besieged territory after Palestinians were prevented from working and violence broke out. The crossings were opened on Thursday after nearly two weeks of demonstrations by Palestinian workers through an informal agreement Qatar helped mediate alongside a flurry of diplomacy involving Egypt, Israel and Hamas. “The situation in the Gaza Strip is dire and another conflict will only exacerbate the humanitarian crisis. Qatar has worked and succeeded in de-escalating the situation in the Gaza Strip by mediating an understanding to reopen the Erez crossing for Palestinian workers,” Qatar’s envoy to Gaza, Mohammad al-Emadi, was quoted by media as saying. “Qatar will spare no efforts in supporting the Palestinian people through diplomacy and developmental initiatives until they achieve their aspirations for statehood and prosperity,” he added. Israel shut the Beit Hanoun crossing – called “Erez” by Israel – with Gaza in advance of the Rosh Hashanah Jewish holiday. For nearly two weeks,Israeli troops faced offagainst the protesting labourers, responding with live fire that killed at least one man and wounded dozens more.  The reopening allows thousands of Palestinian workers to return to their jobs in Israel and the occupied West Bank. About 18,000 Gazans have permits from Israeli authorities to work outside the blockaded enclave, providing an injection of cash amounting to some $2m a day to the impoverished territory’s economy. Jobs in Israel are in high demand, paying up to 10 times as much as similar jobs in Gaza. Unemployment in the Palestinian territory – which has been under an Israeli-Egyptian blockade since 2007 – hovers at 50 percent. “We want to go to work and earn a living for our children because the situation was too bad for us the past two weeks,” said Khaled Zurub, 57, who works in construction in Israel. The crossing closure was a “nightmare”, said Mohammad al-Kahlout, a labourer waiting to cross into Israel on Thursday. “It felt like someone was trying to suffocate you.” Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry agency that coordinates with the Palestinians, said security assessments will determine whether the Gaza crossing point will remain open. After the Erez crossing reopened, Palestinian protest organisers announced they would suspend the daily rallies, but promised to resume demonstrations if Israel did not adhere to its commitments. "

Fazal Akbar, a senior police officer at Hangu, told reporters the two suspected attackers tried to enter a police station near the mosque, but they were fired upon by the officials. “One of them blew himself up at the gate but the other managed to enter the mosque. Thankfully, most of the people inside the mosque managed to escape after the first blast, which is why the casualty count is low,” he said. Officials said there were between 30 to 40 people inside the mosque offering the congregational Friday prayers when the explosion took place. Thetwin blastsrocked Pakistan as Muslims celebrated the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad. “We now have five confirmed casualties, while another six critically injured have been transferred to hospital,” Bilal Faizi, spokesperson for Rescue 1122 helpline, told Al Jazeera. Faizi said the blast caused the roof of the mosque to collapse as the Friday prayer sermons were going on. He said heavy machinery is being used to remove the debris of the roof. Many people are still feared trapped under the rubble, he added. Amir Rana, director of Islamabad-based Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies, said the two blasts appear to be the work of ISIL (ISIS) group. “This is an alarming development. We have historically seen ISIL and its affiliates targeting religious movements and religious centres of worship,” he told Al Jazeera. Meanwhile, another armed group, the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), distanced itself from the twin explosions on Friday. Earlier this year, more than 100 people died in a bomb blast at a mosque situated inside police quarters in in Peshawar city of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Pakistan saw a dramatic surge in armed attacks this year, with more than 300 such incidents attacks reported only from the northwestern province."
"EU’s Mediter­ranean, south­ern Eu­ro­pean lead­ers meet in Mal­ta on mi­gra­tion",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/eus-mediterranean-southern-european-leaders-meet-in-malta-on-migration,"The sum­mit comes af­ter the UN says 2,500 peo­ple had per­ished or dis­ap­peared cross­ing the Mediter­ranean this year.","The leaders of nine Mediterranean and southern European countries, including France’s Emmanuel Macron and Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, have met in Malta for talks focusing on migration. The summit comes on Friday, a day after the UN refugee organisation said more than 2,500 migrants had perished or disappeared attempting to cross the Mediterranean so far this year – substantially more than at the same point in 2022. But it also comes as EU interior ministers finally made headway on Thursday on new rules for how the bloc handles asylum seekers and irregular migrants, with a deal expected in the coming days. Long in the works, there was new impetus to reach a deal after a sharp rise in asylum seekers landing on the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa earlier this month. Meloni’s far-right coalition government, elected on an anti-migration ticket, has clashed with both France and Germany as she presses other EU countries to share the burden. So far this year, the number of arrivals at Lampedusa has already passed 133,000. But Meloni and Macron have sought to ease tensions in recent days and met on Tuesday in Rome on the sidelines of the state funeral for ex-Italian President Giorgio Napolitano. “There is a shared vision of the management of the migration question between France and Italy,” a French presidential source said. Paris is hoping Friday’s so-called Med9 summit, attended by the leaders of Malta, France, Greece, Italy, Croatia, Cyprus, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain, will offer a “clear message” that migration requires a response at the European level, the source said. The EU is poised to agree a revamped Pact on Migration and Asylum, which will seek to relieve pressure on frontline countries such as Italy and Greece by relocating some arrivals to other EU states. Those countries opposed to hosting asylum seekers – Poland and Hungary among them – would be required to pay the ones that do take migrants in. Disagreements within the 27-nation bloc over the proposed revisions have now largely been overcome, EU home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson said on Wednesday after the interior ministers’ meeting. A formal agreement is expected “in a few days”, she said.  Both Meloni and Macron also want to prevent boats departing from North Africa by working more closely with Tunisia, despite questions over the country’s human rights standards and treatment of migrants. The European Commission said last week it was set to release the first instalment of funds to Tunisia – one of the main launching points for boats – under a plan to bolster its coastguard and tackle traffickers. Italy’s Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi met with his Tunisian and Libyan counterparts in Sicily on Thursday for talks on stopping the boats, the ministry said. Rome and Paris are also keen to intensify EU controls at sea. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who is at the Malta summit, included the possible expansion of naval missions in the Mediterranean in a 10-point action plan this month in Lampedusa. There are fears arrivals could spiral further if instability in the Sahel affects North African countries. The Med9 summit, which brings together Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain, is expected to call for greater investment by the bloc in the so-called Southern Neighbourhood. Extra funding may be earmarked for countries across the Mediterranean’s southern shore in the review of the EU’s 2021-2027 long-term budget, a European diplomatic source told the AFP news agency. The leaders will also discuss regional challenges posed by natural disasters following a devastating earthquake in Morocco, a flood disaster in Libya, and extreme weather events in Southern Europe."

A dozen sol­diers killed af­ter rebel at­tack in south­west Niger,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/a-dozen-soldiers-killed-after-rebel-attack-in-southwest-niger,The deaths come as for­mer colo­nial pow­er France pre­pares to with­draw a coun­terin­sur­gency force sta­tioned in the coun­try.,"Seven soldiers have been killed in Niger’s southwest in an attack by suspected rebels, and five others died in a traffic accident while trying to respond to the assault. The deaths on Thursday come as former colonial power France prepares to withdraw a counterinsurgency force stationed in the country at the request of its new military leaders, who seized power in a coup two months ago. Niger’s defence minister, Salifou Mody, said in a statement that a military unit had been “violently attacked by several hundred terrorists” in the town of Kandadji on Thursday, adding that seven soldiers were killed in the fighting. “During an intervention” launched in response to the attack, “a tragic traffic accident led to the loss of five of our brave soldiers”, he continued. Another seven people were injured and evacuated to a hospital, he said. “A search and sweep operation is now underway in order to track down the enemy,” the minister said. The Tillaberi region, where the attack took place, is located in the so-called “three borders” zone where Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali meet. The area is a hideout for rebels, particularly those affiliated with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group. The country’s southwest, where it shares a border with Nigeria, is similarly plagued by attacks by Boko Haram and its dissident branch, the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP). The leaders of the coup thattoppledNiger’s elected government in late July had cited the deterioration of the security situation in the country as justification. According to Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), a conflict aggregator, the number of deaths from rebel attacks in Niger has risen since the generals seized power. “The first month of junta rule in Niger was marked by a 42 percent increase in political violence compared to the month prior,” the ACLED report read. In mid-August, at least 17 soldiers were killed and 20 wounded in a suspected rebel attack near the border with Burkina Faso. It was the deadliest known attack in the country since the coup.  France is currently preparing to withdraw – as demanded by the post-coup government – a contingent of 1,500 troops stationed in Niger as part of a counterinsurgencydeployment in the Sahel region. French President Emmanuel Macron has said the pullout would be completed by the end of the year, while alleging that the country’s post-coup authorities “no longer wanted to fight against terrorism”. The coup against democratically elected president Mohamed Bazoum was the third in the region in as many years, following similar actions in Mali and Burkina Faso, both of which were also once French colonies. The earlier coups also forced the pullouts of French troops, and all three countries have been targeted by rebel attacks for several years. The United States, which has about 1,100 military personnel in Niger, has said it will “evaluate” its future steps following France’s announcement that its troops would withdraw."
Har­ry Pot­ter ac­tor Michael Gam­bon dies aged 82,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/harry-potter-actor-michael-gambon-dies-aged-82,"Irish ac­tor known for play­ing Al­bus Dum­b­le­dore died af­ter be­com­ing ill with pneu­mo­nia, fam­i­ly state­ment says.","Michael Gambon, who played the wise professor Albus Dumbledore in the Harry Potter movie franchise, has died at age 82. Gambon began acting on stage in the early 1960s and later moved into TV and film. Notable film roles include a mob leader in Peter Greenaway’s The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover in 1989, and the elderly King George V in Tom Hooper’s The King’s Speech in 2010. But his best-known role was as Dumbledore, a character he took over in the third instalment of the eight-movie series after he replaced the late Richard Harris in 2004. Gambon played down the praise for his performance and said he simply played himself “with a stuck-on beard and a long robe”. Michael John Gambon was born on October 19, 1940, in Dublin to a seamstress mother and an engineer father. The family moved to Camden Town in London when Gambon was six as his father sought work in the city’s post-war rebuilding. Gambon left school aged 15 to begin an engineering apprenticeship and by 21 he was fully qualified. However, he was also a member of an amateur theatre group and always knew he would act, he told The Herald newspaper in 2004. He was inspired by American actors Marlon Brando and James Dean, who he believed reflected the angst of teenage boys. Gambon built his reputation on the stage during the 1960s. The 1980s brought wider attention with the lead role in 1986 TV show The Singing Detective, in which he played a writer suffering from a debilitating skin condition whose imagination provided the only escape from his pain. The performance won him one of his four BAFTAs. He also won three Olivier Awards and two ensemble cast Screen Actors Guild Awards for Gosford Park and The King’s Speech. Gambon was made a Commander of the British Empire in 1992 and knighted for services to drama in 1998, something he called “a nice little present” – although he did not use the title. A mischievous personality, he often made up stories. For years he showed fellow actors a signed photograph of Robert De Niro that he inscribed himself before ever meeting the American actor. He revealed in an episode of The Late Late Show in Ireland that he convinced his mother he was friends with the pope. Gambon retired from the stage in 2015 after suffering long-term memory problems but continued to act on screen until 2019. He told an interviewer in 2002 his work made him feel like “the luckiest man in the world”."
‘In­cred­i­bly sad day’: Teen ar­rest­ed in Eng­land af­ter felling an­cient tree,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/boy-arrested-in-england-over-deliberate-felling-of-famous-tree,"The tree stood for near­ly 200 years next to the Ro­man land­mark Hadri­an’s Wall, a UN­ESCO World Her­itage Site.","A 16-year-old boy has been arrested in northern England in connection with what authorities described as the “deliberate” felling of a famous tree that had stood for nearly 200 years next to the Roman landmark Hadrian’s Wall. Thousands of visitors each year walk along Hadrian’s Wall, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that guarded the Roman Empire’s northwestern frontier. Many pause to admire and photograph the tree at Sycamore Gap, a beloved icon of the landscape made famous when it appeared in Kevin Costner’s 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves. Photographs from the scene on Thursday showed the tree was cut down near the base of its trunk, with the rest of it lying on its side. Northumbria Police said the teen was arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage. He was in police custody and assisting officers with their inquiries. “The tree is a world-renowned landmark and the vandalism has caused understandable shock and anger throughout the local community and beyond,” police said in a statement. “This is an incredibly sad day,” police Superintendent Kevin Waring said. “The tree was iconic to the North East and enjoyed by so many who live in or who have visited this region.” The Northumberland National Park authority asked the public not to visit the felled tree, which was voted English Tree of the Year in 2016. Alison Hawkins, who was walking on the Hadrian’s Wall path, was one of the first people who saw the destruction. “It was a proper shock. It’s basically the iconic picture that everyone wants to see,” she said. “You can forgive nature doing it – but you can’t forgive that.”"

Sus­pect­ed sui­cide blast death toll in Pak­istan’s Balochis­tan climbs to 52,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/blast-at-rally-to-mark-prophet-birthday-in-pakistan-kills-many-injures-dozens,Pow­er­ful ‘sui­cide’ bomb ex­plodes at ral­ly cel­e­brat­ing the birth­day of Prophet Muham­mad in south­west Pak­istan.,"The death toll from a suspected suicide bomb blast at a procession to celebrate the birthday of Prophet Muhammad in Pakistan’s Balochistan province has climbed to 52, officials and media reports say. The powerful bomb exploded on Friday near a mosque in Mastung district of Balochistan, wounding dozens of others, including many in a critical condition, local officials said. The Reuters news agency, quoting Abdul Rasheed, a district health official, said at least 52 people had died in the blast and 58 others were wounded. Rasheed said the toll could further rise as many people were in a serious condition. “It seems a suicide attack” senior local police officer Javed Lehri, adding that the bomber blew himself up near the vehicle of Deputy Superintendent of Police Nawaz Gishkori. Balochistan’s government administrator Atta Ullah said a senior police officer, Mohammad Nawaz, was among the dead. The injured were taken to nearby hospitals, he said. The country’s interior ministry confirmed a blast carried out by “terrorist elements” in Balochistan. “The attack on innocent people who came to participate in the procession of Eid Milad-un-Nabi is a very heinous act,” it said in a statement, referring to the prophet’s birthday. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack yet. The Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), quickly distanced itself from the attack. The TTP is a separate group but a close ally of the Afghan Taliban, which seized power in neighbouring Afghanistan in August 2021. Last year, the group broke a ceasefire with the government which led to a resurgence of its deadly attacks across the country. Al Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder said the TTP, which had been carrying out attacks in the area, has denied it was involved. “And that of course would raise alarm bells because the area has seen the presence of Islamic State [ISIL or ISIS] elements,” he said. Friday’s bombing came days after authorities asked police to remain on maximum alert as armed groups could target rallies making the occasion. Muslims in Pakistan and around the world celebrate the birthday of Islam’s prophet by holding public gatherings. While the celebration is accepted by a majority of Islamic sects, certain denominations view it as an unwarranted innovation. Pakistan has in the past been the site of attacks by armed groups. Earlier this month, at least 11 people, including a prominent religious leader, were injured in a blast in the same district of Balochistan, the Dawn newspaper said. In July, more than 40 people were killed in a suicide bombing in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province at a religious political party’s gathering. The gas-rich Balochistan province at the border of Afghanistan and Iran has been the site of a low-intensity rebellion by Baloch separatists for more than two decades. The separatists initially wanted a share of the provincial resources, but later launched a movement calling for independence."
US sues Tes­la over al­leged ‘per­va­sive racial’ abuse against Black work­ers,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/29/us-sues-tesla-over-alleged-pervasive-racial-abuse-against-black-workers,"The law­suit seeks un­spec­i­fied dam­ages, com­pen­sa­tion and an or­der that Tes­la curb racism at its plant in Cal­i­for­nia.","A government anti-discrimination agency in the United States is taking legal action against Elon Musk’s Tesla, accusing the company of allowing the “pervasive racial harassment” of Black workers at its flagship California car factory, and taking retaliatory action against those who complained. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal body, said Black workers had routinely endured stereotyping, racial insults and hostility since at least 2015. The court action, which follows a breakdown in mediation, adds federal charges to discrimination claims already filed by thestate of California,lawsuits byindividual Tesla employees, and a class action suit involving about 240 workers. The electric car company “subjected Black employees at its manufacturing facilities in Fremont, California … to severe or pervasive racial harassment and created and maintained a hostile work environment because of their race,” the lawsuit said. “The racial misconduct was frequent, ongoing, inappropriate, unwelcome and occurred across all shifts, departments and positions,” the commission said. The suit said the factory walls had graffiti that included swastikas, nooses and threats, with some of it allegedly on vehicles rolling off the production line. The commission said Black workers routinely endured racist slurs including variations of the “N-word,” along with “monkey” and “boy”. “Slurs were used casually and openly in high-traffic areas and at worker hubs,” according to the commission. Tesla announced last year that the EEOC had formally raised concerns about the situation at the factory. In the other cases, the company has said it does not tolerate discrimination and takes workers’ complaints seriously. There was no immediate response from Tesla or Musk on the EEOC action. According to the legal documents, Tesla supervisors and managers witnessed racial abuses but did not intervene, and Tesla failed to take steps to address the misconduct. Black Tesla workers who complained of racist treatment found themselves switched to undesirable duties or shifts, written up unjustly or even discharged, the lawsuit said. “After I voiced my unhappiness, I started getting written up for every little thing that was acceptable before – like listening to music while working,” court documents quoted a Black Tesla worker as saying. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages along with compensation for wronged Black workers and an order that Tesla curb racism at the factory. California sued Tesla last year through the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which enforces the state’s civil rights laws and is similar to the EEOC, saying it had received hundreds of complaints from workers. Tesla at that time released a statement saying it opposed “all forms of discrimination and harassment” and that it was committed to providing “a workplace that is safe, respectful, fair and inclusive”. Separately, a number of female Tesla workers filed lawsuits in 2021 alleging sexual harassment at the Fremont plant."
