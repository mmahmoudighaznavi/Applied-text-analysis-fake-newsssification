Hong Kong drenched and bat­tered by weak­en­ing Ty­phoon Koinu,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/9/hong-kong-drenched-and-battered-by-weakening-typhoon-koinu,"Schools closed as city is­sues sec­ond ‘black’ rain warn­ing – its high­est – in a month amid tor­ren­tial rain, strong winds.","Hong Kong has closed schools and suspended trading on the stock exchange after a weakening Typhoon Koinu brought torrential rain and storm-force winds to the southern Chinese territory. More than 150mm of rain was recorded over most parts of Hong Kong from midnight into Monday morning, with rainfall exceeding 300mm in some areas, data showed. The Hong Kong Observatory issued a “black” rainstorm warning – its highest – for about six hours before it was downgraded at 10.30am (02:30 GMT), a month after the city was paralysed by theworst floods in 140 years. While Koinu, which killed one person in Taiwan last week, had weakened into a severe tropical storm, it still brought significant disruption. Schools and childcare centres were ordered to shut and the morning session at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange was suspended. Trade was expected to resume at 2pm (06:00 GMT). Hundreds of passengers were stranded at Hong Kong’s airport overnight and underground metro stations as Koinu disrupted flights and transport, public broadcaster RTHK reported. In early September, Hong Kong was brought to a standstill by torrential rain that swamped streets andflooded shopping malls and metro stations. A “black” warning was also issued then. In China’s Guangdong province – where Koinu is expected to sweep past en route to Hainan island – the cities of Zhuhai and Jiangmen issued a Level III emergency response, according to the Xinhua news agency on Sunday. The alert meant more than 35,500 fishing boats had to return to port, while dozens of coastal scenic areas were temporarily closed. Southern China is frequently hit during the summer and autumn seasons by typhoons that form in the warm oceans east of the Philippines and then travel west. But climate change has made tropical storms more unpredictable while increasing their intensity – bringing more rain and stronger gusts that lead to flash floods and coastal damage, experts say."
"UN Se­cu­ri­ty Coun­cil meets on Gaza-Is­rael, but fails to agree on state­ment",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/9/un-security-council-meets-on-gaza-israel-but-fails-to-agree-on-statement,US push­es for harsh con­dem­na­tion of Hamas but fails to achieve the con­sen­sus nec­es­sary for a state­ment.,"The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has met behind closed doors in an emergency session amid the war between Israel and Gaza but failed to achieve the unanimity needed for a joint statement. At least 1,100 people have already been killed since Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls the blockaded Gaza Strip, launched an assault on Israeli towns on Saturday and took hundreds of people hostage. Israel retaliated by declaring astate of warand pounding densely-populated Gaza, killing hundreds of people. The United States called on the council’s 15 members to strongly condemnHamas. “There are a good number of countries that condemned the Hamas attacks. They’re obviously not all,” senior US diplomat Robert Wood told reporters after the session. “You could probably figure out one of them without me saying anything,” said Wood, in a reference to Russia, whose relations with the West have deteriorated sharply since its invasion of Ukraine. The council met for about 90 minutes and heard a briefing from the UN Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland. Diplomats said members led by Russia were hoping for a broader focus than condemning Hamas. A statement needs to be agreed upon by consensus. “My message was to stop the fighting immediately and to go to a ceasefire and to meaningful negotiations, which was told for decades” by the Security Council, said Vassily Nebenzia, Russia’s UN ambassador. “This is partly the result of unresolved issues,” he said. The United Arab Emirates, whichnormalised relations with Israelas part of a landmark 2020 deal, said it expected more UNSC meetings on the crisis. “I think everyone understands that today, the situation is one of grave concern,” said the UAE Ambassador Lana Zaki Nusseibeh. “Many members of the Council believe that a political horizon leading to a two-state solution is the only way to finally solve this conflict,” she said.  Neither Israel nor the Palestinian Authority (PA), based in the West Bank and a political rival to Hamas, attended the meeting because they are currently on the Security Council. The Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour called on diplomats to focus on ending the Israeli occupation. “Regrettably, history for some media and politicians starts when Israelis are killed,” he said. “This is not a time to let Israel double down on its terrible choices. This is a time to tell Israel it needs to change course, that there is a path to peace where neither Palestinians nor Israelis are killed.” In an open letter sent to UNSC members ahead of the meeting, three Palestinian human rights organisations said the UN’s inaction had enabled the latest violence and meant its members were “complicit” in what had happened. The Palestine-based organisations – Al-Haq, Al-Mezan Centre for Human Rights and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights – called on UN member states to address the “root causes and protect the Palestinian people from Israeli attacks”. Meanwhile, ahead of the meeting, Israel’s UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan showed graphic pictures of Israeli civilians being taken captive by Hamas. “These are war crimes – blatant, documented war crimes,” Erdan told reporters. “This unimaginable, unimaginable atrocity must be condemned. Israel must be given steadfast support to defend ourselves – to defend the free world.”  Home to some 2 million people and measuring about 365sq km (141sq miles), theGaza Striphas been ruled by Hamas since 2007 since a brief war with forces loyal to the PA. Its assault in Israel coincides with US-backed moves to nudge Saudi Arabia towards normalising ties with Israel in return for a defence deal between Washington and Riyadh. “We don’t see any reason that should be off the table,” said Erdan. “We still want it to happen. We’ll do everything that we can to live in co-existence with all of our neighbours.”"

"US to hike mil­i­tary aid, send mil­i­tary ships and air­craft clos­er to Is­rael",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/8/us-to-hike-military-aid-send-military-ships-and-aircraft-closer-to-israel,Hamas has la­belled the US an­nounce­ment to send war­ships clos­er to Is­rael as ‘ag­gres­sion’ against Pales­tini­ans.,"The United States has said it will send multiple military ships and aircraft closer to Israel as a show of support followingSaturday’s surprise attackby the Palestinian armed groupHamas. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Sunday said Washington will also increase military aid and provide munitions to Israel. Hamas has labelled the US announcement as “aggression” against Palestinians. “The announcement of the US that it will provide an aircraft carrier to support the occupation [Israel] is actual participation in the aggression against our people,” the group said in a statement. Israel battered Palestinians with air strikes in the besieged Gaza Strip on Sunday, withhundreds reportedly killedon both sides. Austin said the US believes Hamas’s latest attack could also be aimed at disrupting a potential normalising of ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Austin said the security assistance to Israel will begin moving on Sunday and that the US will be adding fighter jets to the region as well. The US has also ordered the moving of a carrier strike group closer to Israel, which includes the Ford carrier and ships that support it. “I have directed the movement of the USS Gerald R Ford Carrier Strike Group to the Eastern Mediterranean,” Austin said in a statement. US President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday that additional assistance for the Israeli army was on its way. US Vice President Kamala Harris, meanwhile, held a call with Israeli President Isaac Herzog. Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from Washington, DC, said the US contributes $3bn a year in military aid to Israel. “I have been told that among the munitions will be a support for [Israel’s] Iron Dome system… that is an intercept system for missiles and rockets being fired into Israel, which failed spectacularly on Saturday morning,” he said. Earlier on Sunday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the CNN network that “it wouldn’t be a surprise that part of the motivation [for Hamas’s attack] may have been to disrupt efforts to bring Saudi Arabia and Israel together, along with other countries that may be interested in normalising relations with Israel”. Hamas on Saturday said its attack was driven by what it called escalated Israeli attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank, Jerusalem and inIsraeli prisons. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh had highlighted threats to Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque, the continuation of an Israeli blockade on Gaza and Israeli normalisation with countries in the region. Netanyahu last month said he believed his country was on the cusp of peace with Saudi Arabia, predicting that the move could reshape the Middle East. Saudi Arabia has long insisted on the Palestinians’ right to statehood as a condition for recognising Israel, something many members of Netanyahu’s nationalist religious coalition have long resisted. The US on Sunday said the Saudi-Israel normalisation efforts should continue despite the latest attack. “We think it would be in both countries’ interests to continue to pursue this possibility,” US Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer told Fox News."
"‘Where do we go?’: Gaza res­i­dents as Is­rael de­clares war, bombs homes",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/8/no-place-for-gaza-residents-to-flee-after-israel-declares-war-bombs-homes,"Res­i­den­tial build­ings in be­sieged strip bombed by Is­rael forces, killing hun­dreds, af­ter Hamas’s un­prece­dent­ed at­tack.","Gaza City– Amer Ashour’s pregnant wife started having labour pains just as Israel began to bombard the besieged Gaza Strip on Saturday night. They rushed to a nearby maternity hospital where the couple was blessed with a baby boy, their second child. But what they did not expect was to return home and find no trace of it except for a pile of rubble and stones. Israel’s forces bombed the 11-storey building the couple lived in, in the Al-Nasr neighbourhood in the west of Gaza City, after the Palestinianarmed group Hamaslaunched an unprecedented attack inside Israel earlier on Saturday. “What I feared most when the escalation began was that my wife was about to give birth. I was worried how we would get to the hospital in light of the continuous bombing,” Ashour told Al Jazeera. “But I did not at all expect my house will be bombed and destroyed.” Israel on Sundaydeclared a “state of war”and approved “significant military steps” after Hamas’s surprise attack. The fierce battles that followed have killed more than 1,000 people – including at least 400 in Gaza – and wounded thousands on both sides.  Approximately 80 families inhabited the building in Gaza City Ashour lived in. “Today, all of us, our children and women, are homeless,” he said as he pulled his belongings from the rubble. “Where will we go in these difficult times?” Shadi Al-Hassi and his elder brother fled their home in the east of the Gaza Strip after it was damaged following an air strike on a building behind their house. They went to their parents’ apartment in Al-Watan Tower in downtown Gaza City. “At four o’clock in the morning, I was surprised by calls to us to evacuate the tower, which had been threatened with Israeli bombing,” Al-Hassi told Al Jazeera. Civil defence vehicles and ambulances rushed to evacuate the building’s residents minutes before it was bombed, causing panic among the families that lived there. “Until this moment, I am still in shock that the tower was targeted. A residential and civilian tower par excellence, with clinics, companies and a beauty centre? Where is the military activity that Israel claims?” Al-Hassi told Al Jazeera. “Now all of us, my brother and my family, were rendered homeless within hours and we don’t know what’s coming next.” Youssef Al-Bawab, who lived in a building opposite the Al-Watan Tower, told Al Jazeera they received a warning from Israeli forces at 5pm local time (14:00 GMT) to evacuate their house. “We felt very frightened. The tower is only a few metres away from us and it is a civilian tower. We did not notice any resistance activities in it as Israel claimed.” The building in which Al-Bawab lived with 150 other people was badly damaged and became uninhabitable. Several other houses and buildings around the Al-Watan Tower were also severely damaged after the bombing. “Israel says it is targeting resistance fighters, military sites and buildings belonging to Hamas, but the truth is otherwise. I believe Israel is deliberately targeting civilians and displacing them to put more pressure on Hamas,” Al-Bawab said. “But what is our fault? Where do we go?” Mohammed Salah, from Beit Lahia neighbourhood in the north of Gaza, said he left his home and took shelter in a United Nations-run school with other families from the area. “Last night, Israeli aeroplanes randomly bombed our area. The situation was very dangerous, so I left my home with other families,” he told Al Jazeera. “Israeli bombs don’t differentiate between civilians and resistance fighters. In every war, we leave our homes because of the indiscriminate bombing.” “We have been living in this for years, with no one defending or standing for us. We have the right to resist our occupier,” Salah said."
"Peo­ple in quake-hit Afghanistan use shov­els, bare hands to pull out vic­tims",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/8/people-in-quake-hit-afghanistan-use-shovels-bare-hands-to-pull-out-victims,"More than 2,000 dead as search con­tin­ues for those trapped un­der de­bris af­ter mag­ni­tude 6.3 earth­quake hits the na­tion.","Volunteers and rescue workers in quake-hit Afghanistan say they are forced to use shovels and even their bare hands to look for victims and survivors. “There is no modern equipment nor trained search and rescue teams. This could result in a rise in casualties. If we don’t urgently receive advanced and trained rescue teams in the area soon, we will see an increase in the loss of lives that could have been avoided,” Sabir, a rescue worker in western Afghanistan’s Herat province, told Al Jazeera on Sunday. He urged the international community to send rescue teams to the impoverished South Asian country, which lacks a robust disaster management agency and other resources since the Taliban regained power two years ago. According to official figures, at least 2,053 people have been killed and nearly 10,000 injured after themagnitude 6.3 quakeand several aftershocks hit the aid-dependent country on Saturday morning. Sabir said the actual toll could be higher. “We still don’t know about casualties because most people – dead or alive – are still buried under the debris,” he said, adding that it was hard to put a number on how many are still trapped.  Sabir said he was jolted awake when the powerful earthquakeshook the ground. “It was unlike anything I had experienced before,” the 30-year-old told Al Jazeera by telephone “It was a massive vibration, and I felt fear, anxiety and panic altogether,” he said. Shortly after ensuring his family’s safety, Sabir, an aid worker with a local NGO, reported to work to help with the emergency response. It was only after arriving in the Zenda Jan district of Herat, the quake’s epicentre, that he witnessed the extent of the impact of the tragedy. At least 13 villages in this district alone were deeply affected, he said. “The scenes I witnessed are some of the most horrible things I have seen in my life,” Sabir told Al Jazeera, adding that villages with more than 400 households had been turned into ruins. “At least nine villages in the district had been completely razed with no structures left standing,” he said. “There were children, women and the elderly among the bodies that were being pulled out.”  Sabir said there was an urgent need for food, water and shelter, especially for women and children who lost their homes. “There is a shortage of water and food, and families, women and children, don’t have any shelter or tents to protect them from the weather and cold night,” he said, adding that volunteers brought in some resources, but they were not sufficient. “Lots of volunteers from Herat city travelled to these sites, which was very useful and helped save lives, but there is a lot more that is still needed,” he said. Sabir said apart from food, water and tents, the survivors also need medical and psychosocial support. “One requirement in particular is the care of many children who were orphaned or are separated from their families. They need psychosocial support, someone to take care of them,” he said. However, a significant reduction in foreign funds since the Taliban takeover in 2021 has left aid-dependent Afghanistan vulnerable to humanitarian crises. Additionally, there is also a dearth of skilled workers because many Afghans with expertise fled the country after the Taliban regained power. Local officials and residents said they are struggling to conduct search and rescue operations. “The crisis is already out of the capacity of the local authorities in Herat. It needs a more concentrated response, and there is a need for modern rescue equipment, which we don’t have,” said Abdul Baset Rahmani, a disaster management expert who has joined the volunteers in Herat. Despite mounting challenges, rescuers and volunteers remain hopeful of saving more lives. “This village has a population of nearly 2,000. We only found 40 people. The rest are still buried. Many of them are alive,” Sabir said as he helped the rescue work in Herat’s Naib Rafi village. He said he walked past each pile of rubble that used to be a house and called out to anyone who might reply. “I kept calling, ‘Is anyone there?’ and then we heard a voice. ‘Yes, I am alive,’” he said. Sabir and his colleagues quickly helped dig a man out alive – the sole survivor in his family. “It was the most distressing moment of my life,” Sabir said."
Tel Aviv’s res­i­dents start ven­tur­ing out,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/8/tel-avivs-resident-start-venturing-out,"The Is­raeli city wakes up from its shock and con­fu­sion, mak­ing timid ef­forts to con­front a new re­al­i­ty.","As the fighting between the Israeli army and Hamas rolled into itssecond day, Tel Aviv began to wake up from its daze. Biking through the streets was eerie, and people looked at one another with fear and even veiled suspicion on their faces. While beaches and public spaces remained mostly empty, a few residents could be seen walking their dogs, going for a bike ride or just taking a walk. Curious people stopped and gathered around crews working to clear rubble from the side of a road. Two buildings had been struck by aHamas rocket barrageon Saturday night, injuring four people. Most restaurants have remained closed. A few reopened their commercial kitchens for thewar effort, such as a pizzeria that had a pick-up truck outside with hundreds of pizza boxes stacked in its bed, ready for delivery to soldiers. The pizzeria has stopped selling to the public, making food only for soldiers. People approach the volunteers preparing food for delivery to the south, asking how they can help and offering to donate. Some restaurants are still serving Tel Aviv, and some food delivery scooters sped down the empty streets, bringing food to the many Israelis who are still indoors, glued to their televisions and watching the news unfold. Police patrols pass by, stopping people here and there to inquire about where they are going. On Saturday night, Israelis and tourists alike flocked to Ben Gurion Airport to try to snag a last flight out of Israel. On Sunday, major airlines cancelled flights to the country. On Saturday night, those who had confirmed tickets waited anxiously to see if their flight would take off. Others came to see if they could buy a last-minute ticket. One traveller described the scene, saying that there were many more people in line at check-in, waiting to see if they could get a ticket, than there were past the security lines at the boarding gates. Many people are bewildered and frightened, made more so by the official declaration of a state of war by the Israeli cabinet on Sunday. A day earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had told Israelis in a video statement: “We are at war. … I call on all citizens of Israel to unite, to achieve our highest goal – victory in the war.” Since Hamas’s surprise attack on Israel on Saturday morning, various sectors of Israeli society have seemingly put their differences aside and focused on the war declaration. For now, the people of Tel Aviv are slowly shaking off their caution and venturing out to try to connect with each other again."
Mar­tinel­li fires Ar­se­nal to late 1-0 win over Man­ches­ter City,https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2023/10/8/martinelli-fires-arsenal-to-late-1-0-win-over-manchester-city,Ar­se­nal get first Pre­mier League win over City since 2015 as sub­sti­tute Mar­tinel­li scores the only goal at the Emi­rates.,"Substitute Gabriel Martinelli has fired a last-gasp winner to earn Arsenal a 1-0 victory over Manchester City, a result that moves Mikel Arteta’s side level on points with North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur at the top of the Premier League. Arsenal came into the match on Sunday having not beaten City in the league since 2015, a run of 15 games – their longest winless streak against a single opponent in league history. Ending such a barren run looked unlikely as City had the better of the chances in the first half with Arsenal’s Declan Rice clearing off the line to keepthe championsat bay. Arsenal did not have a single shot on target in the opening period but upped the tempo after the break, even though City still created the better openings despite their Premier League top scorerErling Haalandbeing kept quiet all afternoon. The game appeared to be edging towards a stalemate before Martinelli struck four minutes from time, a deflection off City defender Nathan Ake that took the ball past keeper Ederson. The goal sparked wild celebrations at the Emirates as Arsenal moved above City into second place on 20 points, two above the champions, and trailing Spurs only on goals scored. Arsenal were dealt a huge blow ahead of kickoff as it was confirmed the injured Bukayo Saka would miss a Premier League game for the first time since May 2021, ending a run of 87 consecutive appearances, the longest ongoing run in the competition. Without the flying forward, Arsenal looked sluggish early on with Croatian defender Josko Gvardiol denied by Rice’s intervention while Julian Alvarez almost diverted Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya’s hesitant clearance into the net. The crowd was doing their best to rouse a response from Arsenal, cheering every flying tackle with gusto, and it seemed to help matters as the hosts grew into the contest. Promising openings fell flat, however, as Arsenal failed to have a shot on target in the opening half of a Premier League home game for the first time since March 2022. Martinelli’s introduction livened things up as he soon had the home side’s first effort on target in the match, a fierce strike straight at Ederson. With the international break to follow, the life seemed to be sucked out of the game before Martinelli broke City hearts. It was a timely strike, ensuring Arsenal are yet to lose a Premier League game this season, last going on a longer unbeaten run to start a campaign in 2007-08. “Everyone knows how hard it is to play against [City], even when they play away. It is not impossible to beat them,” Arsenal forward Gabriel Jesus said after the match. “It is our home, and we have to fight. I am happy for Gabby [Martinelli]. He came on and helped us. He showed how strong our team is.” Martinelli praised his teammates. “Everyone played their part in this victory,” he said. “I scored the goal, but it was about the whole team.”"

The hosts probably expected their chase to be a cakewalk on Sunday after their spin-heavy attack bundled out the five-time champions for 199 with three deliveries left in the Australian innings. India, however, made a shocking start to their reply with three of their top four batters falling for ducks – for the first time in an ODI – inside two overs. Dropped on 12 by Mitchell Marsh off Josh Hazlewood, Kohli went on to make 85 as he masterminded yet another successful chase for India. His partner in the 165-run fourth-wicket stand, KL Rahul, produced a chanceless knock of 97 not out as India reached the target in 41.2 overs. After winning the toss, Australia slumped after being 74-1 in the 17th over. Australia would be particularly unhappy with their batting as no one reached 50 in the low-scoring match although David Warner (41) and Steve Smith (46) got decent starts.  Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav shared five wickets to wreck the Australian innings. On a spin-friendly surface, Jadeja finished with 3-28 in 10 overs while Yadav picked up 2-42 as the duo negated Australia’s advantage of batting first. Mitchell Marsh (0) edged Jasprit Bumrah to slip in the third over with Kohli holding a diving catch. David Warner and Steve Smith stabilised the innings with a 69-run partnership for the second wicket. Warner scored 41 runs and hit six fours but offered a return catch to Yadav just when he looked set for a big innings. India’s spin strategy had an impact with the introduction of Ravichandran Ashwin (1-34) in the eighth over choking the scoring rate. Smith added another 36 runs with Marnus Labuschagne before an armball from Jadeja cleaned up his off-stump in the 28th over. Smith, stunned at the delivery, hit five fours in his 71-ball innings. His dismissal opened the floodgates for India. Two overs later, Jadeja had Labuschagne caught behind and then trapped Alex Carey (0) two balls later. Australia collapsed from 110-2 to 119-5. Glenn Maxwell (15) and Cameron Green (8) batted sedately to stem the flow of wickets, adding 21 runs off 37 balls for the sixth wicket. There was more to come from the Indian spinners, though. Yadav returned to bowl Maxwell in the 36th over. Three balls later, Green was caught off Ashwin as Australia crashed again, this time to 140-7. The Australian tail stuck around to add vital runs with the last three wickets adding 59. Mitchell Starc scored 28 off 35 balls with two fours and a six. Captain Pat Cummins made 15 off 24. Adam Zampa gave them company while facing 20 balls. Even so, Indian pacers finished up the job to restrict Australia to a total well below par for this wicket.  Chasing 200 for victory, the hosts got off to a horrendous start. Ishan Kishan chased a wide delivery in the first over and was out caught at slip off Starc for a golden duck. It was Starc’s 50th wicket in ODI World Cups. Five balls later, Rohit Sharma was out LBW to Josh Hazlewood (3-38). The Indian skipper reviewed but the decision stayed in Australia’s favour. Sharma was out for a six-ball duck. Shreyas Iyer made it three ducks among the top four Indian batters when he drove straight to cover three balls later. The scorecard now read an astonishing two runs for three wickets. Australia could have strengthened its grip on the game – perhaps fatally for India – but Marsh dropped Kohli on 12 in the eighth over. Kohli pulled one off Hazlewood, but Marsh could not complete the running catch despite making ample ground. It was a costly miss as Kohli and Rahul rebuilt the innings, and their partnership led India to opening its World Cup campaign with a win. Kohli was out caught at midwicket by Labuschagne off Hazlewood, but Rahul and Hardik Pandya (11 not out) finished the job. India’s captain, Sharma, praised Kohli and Rahul as well as India’s bowlers. “To start the tournament in the way we did was quite pleasing to see. Our bowlers used the conditions perfectly.” “You don’t want to start your innings like that when you’re chasing that kind of target, but credit to the Aussies. They bowled well,” he added. “Hats off to Virat and KL and how they stuck in the middle out there and created that match-winning partnership for us.” Australia captain, Cummins, was left to rue the drop of Kohli early in the chase. “Not ideal – especially someone of his calibre. Four down would have been the ideal start but not to be,” he said. “It’s only one game out of nine, but there are areas we need to get better.”"

Violent torrents struck Sikkim on Wednesday after a high-altitude glacial lake suddenly burst. Police in Jalpaiguri district, situated in the neighbouring West Bengal state, said 48 bodies were recovered on Sunday, including of eightIndian army personnelstationed in Sikkim, a state on the remote frontiers of Nepal and China with a sizeable military presence. Thousands of people remain stranded in relief camps as bad weather delays airlift rescues. Along with destroying major infrastructure, the floods also damaged more than 1,200 houses, according to officials.  More than 50 climbers were climbing up the summit of Shishapangma in Tibet when an avalanche crashed into them, killing an American mountaineer and her Nepali guide, China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency reported on Sunday. Two avalanches hit the slopes of Shishapangma, the world’s 14th tallest peak, at elevations of 7,600 metres and 8,000 metres on Saturday, killing the American climber Anna Gutu and her Nepali guide Mingmar Sherpa. Another American climber, Gina Marie Rzucidlo, and her Nepali guide, Tenjen Sherpa, were missing, Xinhua said. Climbers from around the world were pushing up the summit in what is a popular month for mountaineering in the Himalayas with eased monsoon rains making the conditions more stable. California was just about to become the first US state to explicitly outlaw caste-based discrimination – until Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed the bill late on Saturday. Last month, California’s senatepassed a billthat added caste as a form of protected ancestry under state civil rights law, as well as education and housing codes. Newsom called the bill “unnecessary” since the state already prohibits discrimination based on various characteristics such as colour, ancestry and national origin. “Because discrimination based on caste is already prohibited under these existing categories, this bill is unnecessary,” he said in a statement.  The debate around the bill has divided the Indian American community, with rights and social justice groups backing it as the most significant victory in combatting casteism in America. Proponents of the bill launched a hunger strike in early September pushing for the law’s passage. A United Nations report in 2016 said at least 250 million people worldwide still face caste discrimination in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Pacific regions, as well as in various diaspora communities. Caste systems are found among Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Jains, Muslims and Sikhs in South Asia. Thenmozhi Soundararajan, executive director of Equality Labs, the Oakland-based Dalit rights group that has been leading the movement to end caste discrimination in the US, said she still viewed the moment as a victory for caste-oppressed people who have “organised and built amazing power and awareness on this issue”. Sultan al-Jaber, the president-designate of COP28 to be held in the United Arab Emirates later this year, on Sunday said adaptation must be “front and centre” of theclimate agenda. “We live in a region of extreme heat, water scarcity and food insecurity. We are also suffering harsh climate impacts, from droughts to the devastating floods of Derna,” Jaber said, speaking at the MENA Climate Week in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh. “To deliver for our region we must put adaptation front and centre of the climate agenda.” Jaber also called on governments to abandon “fantasies” of hastily sideling existing energy infrastructure in pursuit of climate goals. “We cannot unplug the energy system of today before we build the new system of tomorrow. It is simply not practical or possible,” he said. COP28is scheduled to take place in the UAE between November 30 and December 12."
"By sea, by land: Des­per­ate refugees still tran­sit Mo­roc­co to get to Eu­rope",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/8/by-sea-by-land-refugees-still-transiting-morocco-to-get-to-europe,"A month af­ter an earth­quake killed near­ly 3,000 peo­ple, the stream of refugees tran­sit­ing Mo­roc­co to Eu­rope con­tin­ues.","The nearly 3,000 people who died in Morocco’searthquakelast month have refocused the world’s attention upon the kingdom, and a continuing exodus of people from across Africa passing through it to seek new lives in Europe. Asylum seekers launching their journeys from Morocco, unlike those leaving from North African neighbours Tunisia and Libya, have a number of routes they can take to Europe. More than 25,000 refugees and migrants have left Morocco this year so far – fewer than those leaving Tunisia and Libya but still significant. At least 600, possibly many more, have died trying to make the crossing. Asylum seekers, Moroccans or people transiting through the North African country from West Africa, all risk adding to the mounting death toll that the promise of a new life in the West exacts from the desperate. Despite the high waves and vicious rocks that await them, thousands of refugees gather at Moroccan coastal cities like Agadir to take a boat to the Canary Islands, a Spanish island chain off the Atlantic coast of Africa. Shipwrecks and sinkings are commonplace. In August, the Canary Islands said they were overwhelmed by refugee arrivals – 2,692 people that month, more than twice as many as in the same period last year. Others look to the calmer, yet better-policed waters of the Mediterranean for passage, with smugglers even resorting to jet skis to ferry their passengers to Gibraltar, which can be seen from Morocco on a clear day. Between January and June of this year, the NGO Caminando Fronteras said, about 951 people died trying to reach the Canary Islands or the Iberian Peninsula from across North Africa. “It’s more of an artisan business there,” Carmen Gonzalez Enriquez, senior analyst at Spain’s Elcano Royal Institute, told Al Jazeera, comparing Moroccan smuggling to the multimillion-dollar migration operations beingcarried out by Libya’s militias. “We’re looking at very small, local networks,” she added. “All the routes carry extraordinary risks, but the Atlantic is the worst.” A joint committee between Spain, Morocco and the European Union has expressed its regret over every single death. However, despite their best efforts to stop them, refugees still make the perilous journey. Moreover, NGOs that rescue refugee boats in distress have accused various European authorities of ignoring orstalling emergency responsesto the distress calls. In May, a boat with 500 asylum seekers on board was in distress near Malta, but authorities theredid not respond overnightto a report from an NGO with the location of the struggling boat. When the NGO approached the Italian coastguard, they were told that the boat fell in Maltese jurisdiction, a common ploy to avoid rescuing people, NGOs say. In Spain, Caminando speaks of providing the satellite locations of struggling vessels to the border authorities of both Spain and Morocco, only for them to be ignored and the passengers, including women and children, left to drown. “In other words,” the NGO’s founder, Helena Maleno said, being left to die at sea had become “a strategy to control people on the move”. Passage by sea to Europe can be treacherous and access by land can be just as bad. On June 24 last year, a day still referred to as the Melilla massacre, 37 refugees and migrants were killed in confrontations in Melilla, a Spanish territory within Morocco, according to Amnesty International. Desperate to get to “Europe”, they stormed the fences from the Moroccan side and were beaten back by Spanish and Moroccan police. Seventy-six people are still missing, indicating the death toll is far greater. According to Human Rights Watch, no safe and legal routes exist to accessMelillaand Ceuta, the other Spanish territory in Morocco. Both have evolved over recent decades from near-borderless territories to fortified cities whose frontiers are patrolled by armed Spanish and Moroccan police. “In the Rif [the Moroccan area that surrounds the Spanish enclaves] irregular migrants get by in fairly poor camps, waiting to be bussed to Melilla or Ceuta and eventually to Europe,” Ahlam Chemlali, a specialist in migration and visiting scholar to both Yale and the University of California, told Al Jazeera. In ragged tents that dot the mountainside around Melilla, refugees and migrants from across West Africa eke out a living in hostile environments as they wait their turn to risk the border fence. Nevertheless, despite the immense hardship, they show little sign of being deterred by the European Union’s attempts to keep them out. In November, American broadcaster NPRreportedan active operation in the nearby Moroccan town of Nador to push out the predominantly Black refugees and migrants. Officials reportedly pressured shopkeepers and hoteliers to refuse to serve the refugees and migrants. But, the report said, they kept arriving, sometimes in ragged or burned clothing, sometimes without shoes. The numbers of refugees and migrants leaving from Morocco for Spain are dwarfed by those transiting Tunisia and Libya heading for Italy. In the same period that Morocco had roughly 25,000 departures, nearly 60,000 left Tunisia alone. This is because the route is so dangerous and, observers say, the factors pushing West Africans to leave have yet to reach the volatility pushing the people transiting Tunisia and Libya, like war-ravaged Sudan. Certainly, since the Melita massacre, Spain and Morocco have been at pains to cooperate on migration, with Spain hoping to stem the flow of people arriving at its shores seeking new lives in Europe by keeping people in Morocco. Legal pathways to residency have opened up in Morocco since last June’s killings in Melilla, but claims the country might be a poster child for European efforts to externalise its migration concerns beyond its own frontiers are likely overstated, according to experts. “Externalisation doesn’t work,” Chemlali stated. “It never does. Europe might be externalising its migration concerns to Morocco, but it’s also externalising the violence and the racism that comes with migration.” Neither the Moroccan or Spanish governments had responded to Al Jazeera’s requests for comment at the time of publication."

Why are so many Pales­tin­ian pris­on­ers in Is­raeli jails?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/8/why-are-so-many-palestinian-prisoners-in-israeli-jails,One in five Pales­tini­ans spends time in Is­rael jails. Hamas says it wants to ex­change cap­tured Is­raelis for them.,"In golf carts, vans and on motorbikes, Hamas fighters have taken dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers back to the Gaza Strip after their attack on Israel on Saturday. As Israel’s fighter jets bomb the Gaza Strip in retaliation against the surprise Hamas assault, the Palestinian group has said that it plans to use the captured Israelis to strike a deal for therelease of Palestiniansin Israel’s prisons. But just how many Palestinians are currently in Israeli custody? And how many of them are children? Many would argue that all of Gaza is effectively an open-air prison — 2.2 million people blockaded by Israel in a tiny coastal enclave. But the number of Palestinians who have actually spent time in Israeli jails too is of a similar order. Since 1967, when Israel occupied East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, it has arrested an estimated one million Palestinians, the United Nationsreportedlast summer. One in every five Palestinians has been arrested and charged under the 1,600 military orders that control every aspect of the lives of Palestinians living under the Israeli military occupation. That incarceration rate doubles for Palestinian men — two in every five have been arrested. By comparison, in the United States, the country notorious for the world’s largest prison population, one in 200 people is imprisoned. The imprisonment rate among Black Americans is more than three times the overall rate — but even then is a tiny fraction of an average Palestinian’s likelihood of spending time in jail. Palestinian Prisoner rights group Addameer has described the Israeli prison system as a “complex of monstrous machinery in form, laws, procedures, and policies…designed to liquidate and kill”. Today, the number of Palestinians currently behind Israeli bars is 5,200, including 33 women and 170 children. If tried, Palestinian prisoners are prosecuted in military courts. Two months after Israel occupied Palestinian and Arab territories in the 1967 war, its government issued Military Order 101 which essentially criminalised civic activities under the basis of “hostile propaganda and prohibition of incitement”. The order, which is still in use in the occupied West Bank, outlaws the participation and organisation of protests, printing and distributing political material, waving flags and other political symbols, and any activity that demonstrates sympathy for an organisation deemed illegal under military orders. Three years later, another military order (378) was issued by the Israeli government. This established military courts, and basically outlawed all forms of Palestinian resistance to the Israeli occupation as “terrorism”. Hundreds of other military orders have been issued and implemented since then to curtail any Palestinian civic and political expression. There are 19 prisons within Israel and one inside the occupied West Bank that hold Palestinian prisoners. Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, it is against international law for an occupying power to transfer an occupied people from the occupied territory. “It is unlawful and cruel and the consequences for the imprisoned person and their loved ones, who are often deprived from seeing them for months, and at times for years on end, can be devastating,” Amnesty International haspreviouslysaid. There are 1,264 Palestinian administrative detainees, which means that they are held indefinitely behind bars without facing trial or any charges. This practice, a remnant of the British Mandate era, can be extended indefinitely based on “secret evidence”, meaning that a detainee can spend months if not years in prison without being charged. While Israel says the procedure allows authorities to hold suspects while continuing to gather evidence, critics and rights groups say the system is widely abused and denies due process. Since the outbreak of the second Intifada in 2000, more than 12,000 Palestinian children have been detained by Israeli forces. At least 700 Palestinian children under the age of 18 from the occupied West Bank are prosecuted every year through Israeli military courts after being arrested, interrogated and detained by the Israeli army. Addameer describes the arrest and imprisonment of children as systemic and part of a collective punishment campaign. The most common charge is throwing stones, which is punishable by a maximum punishment of 20 years. The children are often subjected tophysical and psychological torture, according to child rights groups. They are interrogated without the presence of a parent or lawyer, and critics have accused Israel of exploiting their detention to turn them into informants and to extort their families financially by forcing them to pay huge fines. Military Order 1726 states that children can be held in preventative detention for 15 days before an indictment is submitted and that a military court can extend that detention by 10 days each time for a maximum of 40 times. Military Order 1745 stipulates that interrogation sessions of children should be audiovisually recorded in a language understood by children, but excludes children arrested under security pretexts which refers to all Palestinian child detainees. Under Military Order 132, Palestinian children aged 16 and older were previously tried and sentenced by Israeli military courts as adults. Furthermore, Palestinian children continue to be charged according to their age at the time of sentencing, instead of their age at the time of the alleged offence, as provided by international law. In August 2016, Israel changed its law that stated that children under 14 could not be held criminally responsible. This was done after Israeli authorities waited forAhmed Manasra, who was 13 years old at the time of his arrest, to turn 14 before charging him with attempted murder and sentencing him to 12 years – which was later commuted down to nine."
The peo­ple vy­ing for Liberia’s pres­i­den­cy on Oc­to­ber 10,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/8/the-people-vying-for-liberias-presidency-on-october,"Pres­i­dent George Weah, who is seek­ing a sec­ond six-year term, is up against 19 oth­er can­di­dates, on Tues­day.","Monrovia, Liberia– On Tuesday, over 2.4 million Liberians head to the polls to elect a president and members of their legislature. Currently, there are 19 candidates hoping to replace incumbent President George Weah of the Coalition of Democratic Change (CDC), who is seeking a second six-year term. The two main challengers are former vice president Joseph Nyuma Boakai and businessman Alexander Cummings. Both men were previously in a four-party opposition alliance, the Coalition of Political Parties (CPP). However, despite initial success, the coalition has since broken up after reported disagreements over who gets the presidential ticket in this election cycle. Also in the running is Liberian People’s Party’s Tiawan Gongloe, a renowned human rights lawyer and professor of law who served as the country’s solicitor general during the Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf administration. The former president became Africa’s first elected female leader in 2006, but inclusivity in politics is still a mirage in many parts of the continent, including her native Liberia. Only two of the 20 contenders in Tuesday’s presidential vote are women, one of whom is Sara Nyanti, a former deputy special representative in the United Nations Mission in South Sudan. Weah, who is running for a second term, has boasted that he will secure outright victory in the first round of elections. He has been in office since 2017. CDC’s Weah has kept current vice president, Jewel Howard-Taylor, as his running mate. Howard-Taylor is the ex-wife of former president Charles Taylor who is serving a 50-year sentence for crimes against humanity committed in neighbouring Sierra Leone, in a British prison. Weah, 57, has said his performance will be enough to secure re-election. He counts as achievement a free tuition scheme for undergraduates of public universities that was instituted in 2018. Weah’s government also pays the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) fees for 9th and 12th graders in public schools. Furthermore, the government has increased electricity access and reduced costs from 38 cents per kilowatt to an average of 15 cents per kilowatt. The administration has also embarked on several road construction projects around the country. Despite these, critics say corruption has been widespread under Weah. They also point to the state of the economy and rising food prices which led to protests in December last year and in June of 2019 as as indicative of government failure. In his manifesto, Weah has promised to reduce out-of-pocket payment for medical expenses through a compulsory social health insurance scheme and has also promised to provide off-the-grid solar energy for public hospitals and secondary schools. He has also promised to create sustainable jobs by formalising artisanal and small-scale mining activities and providing public prosecutors with sexual and gender-based violence training. Joseph Boakai With decades of experience in Liberia’s public sector, Boakai has widespread name recognition and is now aiming for the presidency, under the Unity Party (UP). The 78-year-old was previously minister of agriculture from 1983 to 1985. He was also vice president from 2006 to 2018, to Johnson-Sirleaf. This year, Boakai is in an alliance with the Movement for Democracy and Reconstruction (MDR), founded by former warlord-turned-senator Prince Johnson. Consequently, Boakai has selected MDR senator Jeremiah Koung as his running mate. Johnson and Koung hail from and wield significant influence in Nimba, the second most populous county in the country. MDR previously entered into an alliance with CDC in 2017, supporting it in the second round of elections that Weah eventually won. The alliance dissolved in 2022 amidst Johnson’s complaints of a lack of job opportunities for “his people”. For many, Boakai’s second attempt at the presidency is a rematch with Weah after both men faced each other in 2017. Both men proceeded to the second round after none attained the required absolute majority to claim victory in the first round, Weah eventually won. Building on his experience, Boakai has made agriculture a key campaign issue, vowing to increase domestic rice production and to set up three agricultural machinery hubs in the country. He has also promised to pave the highways connecting county capitals and those connecting Liberia to other countries, in order to improve cross-border trading. The former vice president has also promised to work with the legislature to establish a specialised court to fast-track cases of corruption and economic crimes and to support the private sector in developing programs for recycling solid waste into producing renewable energy. However, critics have said that at 78 years old, Boakai is too old to govern. Boakai has also been accused of facing health challenges, which he has denied. Alexander Cummings Alexander Cummings first became known on the Liberian political scene when he contested for the presidency in 2017 and placed fifth. This year, he is running on the platform of the Collaborating Political Party (CPP), a coalition between Cumming’s Alternative National Congress and the Liberty Party. Cummings, 57, served as the head of Coca-Cola’s African subsidiary between 2001 and 2008 and as its global chief administrative officer from 2008 till he retired in 2016. In his role at Coca-Cola, he oversaw the creation of its Africa Foundation which helped in the continental response to the spread of HIV/AIDS. In 2011, he was awarded Liberia’s highest national honour – the Humane Order of African Redemption – by Johnson-Sirleaf for his humanitarian work. Cummings has centred his campaign on diversifying Liberia’s economy. To this end, he has promised to establish a $20m empowerment fund to support women and youth-owned businesses as well as farmers within his first 100 days in office if he wins, while freezing all current tax and regulations to review in order to create a business-friendly environment. He has also spoken of a “buy Liberian” policy that will prioritise buying locally-made products to boost indigenous businesses. Lastly, he has expressed support for the establishment of a war crimes court to prosecute key characters in the country’s civil wars of 1989-1997 and 1999-2003."
What is Hamas? A sim­ple guide to the armed Pales­tin­ian group,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/8/what-is-the-group-hamas-a-simple-guide-tothe-palestinian-group,The group’s au­da­cious Sat­ur­day at­tack on Is­rael has trig­gered a bloody bomb­ing cam­paign in the Gaza Strip.,"Israel and the armed Palestinian group Hamas are locked in an escalating conflict that has left almost 1,000 people dead in a little more than a day. On Saturday, Hamaslaunched an unprecedentedattack on Israel, blowing up parts of the country’s highly fortified separation fence and sending fighters into Israeli communities along the Gaza frontier. The move prompted the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to warn of “a long and difficult war”. Israeli jets are bombing the Gaza Strip, levelling high rises and civilian neighbourhoods. But what is Hamas, the group at the centre of it all? Here is what to know: Hamas stands for the Islamic Resistance Movement and in Arabic means “zeal”. The group politically controls the Gaza Strip, a territory of about 365sq km (141sq miles) that ishometo more than two million people but is blockaded by Israel. Hamas has been in power in the Gaza Strip since 2007 after a brief waragainst Fatah forcesloyal to President Mahmoud Abbas, the head of the Palestinian Authority and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The Hamas movement was founded in Gaza in 1987 by an imam, Sheikh Ahmed Yasin, and his aide Abdul Aziz al-Rantissi shortly after the start of the first Intifada, an uprising against Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories. The movement started as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and created a military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, to pursue an armed struggle against Israel with the aim of liberating historic Palestine. It also offered social welfare programmes to Palestinian victims of the Israeli occupation.  Unlike the PLO, Hamas does not recognise Israel’s statehood but accepts a Palestinianstate on 1967 borders. “We shall not waive an inch of the Palestinian home soil no matter what the recent pressures are and no matter how long the occupation,” Khaled Meshaal, the leader-in-exile of the Palestinian group said in 2017. Hamas violently opposes the Oslo peace accords negotiated by Israel and the PLO in the mid-1990s. It is formally committed to establishing a Palestinian state within its own borders.It has pursuedthis aim through attacks on Israeli soldiers, settlers and civilians both in the occupied Palestinian territories and in Israel. The group as whole or in some instances its military wing is designated as a “terrorist” organisation by Israel, the United States, European Union, Canada, Egypt and Japan. Hamas is part of a regional alliance that also includes Iran, Syria and the group Hezbollah in Lebanon, which opposes US policies towards the Middle East and Israel. Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the second-largest armed group in the region, are often united against Israel and are the most important members of the joint operations room that coordinates military activity among the various armed groups in Gaza. The relationship between the two groups has been tense when Hamas has exerted pressure on Islamic Jihad to stop attacks against Israel. Hamasspokesperson Khaled Qadomitold Al Jazeera that the group carried out its military operation in response to atrocities that Palestinians have faced over decades. “We want the international community to stop atrocities in Gaza against Palestinian people, our holy sites like Al-Aqsa [Mosque]. All these things are the reason behind starting this battle,” he said. Hamas also called on other groups to join the fight, saying Saturday’s attacks were just the beginning.  Osama Hamdan, senior spokesperson for Hamas, told Al Jazeera that the group was not attacking civilians even though the group’s own videos have shown its fighters taking elderly Israelis hostage during the fighting on Saturday. Rights groups such as Amnesty International have also pointed out that Israeli civilians had been killed by Hamas. But Hamdan insisted that the group was attacking only settlers living in illegal settlements, whom he described as legitimate targets. “You have to differentiate between settlers and civilians. Settlers attacked Palestinians,” Hamdan said. Asked whether civilians in southern Israel were also considered settlers, Hamdan said: “Everyone knows there are settlements there.” “We are not targeting civilians on purpose. We have declared settlers are part of the occupation and part of the armed Israeli force. They are not civilians,” he added. Hamas said its fighters took several Israelis captive in the enclave, releasing videos of fighters dragging bloodied soldiers. It said senior Israeli military officers were among the captives. The videos could not immediately be verified but matched geographic features of the area. Fears that Israelis have been kidnapped evoked memories of the 2006 capture of soldier Gilad Shalit, whom Hamas-linked fighters seised in a cross-border raid. Hamas held Shalit for five years until he was exchanged for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Hamas also sent paragliders flying into Israel, the Israeli military said. The attack recalled a famous assault in the late 1980s when Palestinian fighters crossed from Lebanon into northern Israel on hang-gliders and killed six Israeli soldiers. "

Is­raeli law­mak­er blames pogroms against Pales­tini­ans for ‘ter­ri­ble’ at­tacks,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/8/israeli-lawmaker-blames-pogroms-against-palestinians-for-terrible-attacks,Ofer Cas­sif says he warned the sit­u­a­tion would ‘erupt’ if Is­rael did not change its treat­ment of Pales­tini­ans.,"An Israeli lawmaker has told Al Jazeera that his party warned about events like Saturday’s Hamas attack on Israel if the country’s government continued its illegal occupation of Palestinian lands. Hamas launched a multipronged assault at dawn on Saturday with thousands of rockets fired at Israel, and the Gaza-based group’s fighters infiltrating Israeli towns and illegal settlements. The attack left at least 600 Israelis dead, including dozens of soldiers, with bodies strewn on roads. Meanwhile, at least 313 Palestinians have been killed and more than 1,700 others wounded in Israeli bombardments of the besieged Gaza enclave. Ofer Cassif, a member of the Knesset and leftist Hadash coalition, said he warned the situation would “erupt” if the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not change its policies towards Palestinians. Hadash has four seats in the 120-member Knesset. “We condemn and oppose any assault on innocent civilians. But in contrast to the Israeli government that means that we oppose any assault on Palestinian civilians as well. We must analyse those terrible incidents [the attacks] in the right context – and that is the ongoing occupation,” Cassif said. “We have been warning time and time again… everything is going to erupt and everybody is going to pay a price – mainly innocent civilians on both sides. And unfortunately, that is exactly what happened,” he said. “The Israeli government, which is a fascist government, supports, encourages, and leads pogroms against the Palestinians. There is an ethnic cleansing going on. It was obvious the writing was on the wall, written in the blood of the Palestinians  – and unfortunately now Israelis as well,” he added.  More than 20,000 Palestinians have left Gaza’s border region to head further inside the Hamas-controlled territory to seek refuge in UN schools, according to UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees. Previously, conflicts between Israel and Hamas resulted in extensive devastation in Gaza and days of rocket attacks on Israeli towns. The current escalation appears to be even more precarious than normal, as Israel’s far-right government grapples with the unprecedented security breach, while Palestinians are mired in despair due to the ongoing occupation in the West Bank and the suffocating blockade in Gaza. “The only thing Netanyahu cares about is not the well-being of the citizens of Israel, let alone of Palestinians in the occupied territories,” Cassif said. “He is interested in surviving. He just wants to stay out of prison. That is the only motivation and incentive that drives [him].” Netanyahu is facing numerouslegal troublesat home with the country’s attorney general filing several charges against him, including fraud, breach of trust, and corruption. The Israeli leader has strongly denied the charges. The latest escalationraisesthe prospect of a broader regional conflict. On Sunday, Hezbollah, a powerful armed group backed by Iran, said it had launched guided rockets and artillery onto three posts in Shebaa Farms “in solidarity” with the Palestinian people. Shebaa Farms, which is claimed by Lebanon, was captured by Israel in the 1967 Six Day War.  The Israeli military said on Sunday it fired artillery into an area of Lebanon from where cross-border mortar fire was launched. Israel’s military said one of its drones struck a Hezbollah post in the area of Har Dov, an area in Shebaa Farms. “I’m afraid that some of the elements like Hezbollah are going to join this war. I hope not, of course. Indeed, for the sake of all people, of all civilians, Palestinians and Israelis alike, I hope that that this is going to end as soon as possible,” Cassif said, adding that “the only way to stop the bloodshed of both peoples is to put an end to the occupation”. On Sunday, an Egyptian policemanopened fireon tourists in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria, killing at least two Israeli nationals and one Egyptian, according to local media reports. Extra News television channel, which has close ties to Egyptian security agencies, quoted an unidentified security official as saying that another person was wounded in the attack at an Israeli tour group in Pompey’s Pillar site in Alexandria. “This morning during a visit of Israeli tourists in Alexandria, Egypt, a local opened fire at them, murdering two Israeli citizens and their Egyptian guide,” Israel’s foreign ministry said in a statement. “In addition, there is a wounded Israeli in moderate condition,” the statement added.

More than 300 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli bombardments of the besieged Gaza enclave in the wake of the large-scale Hamas attack that took Israel by surprise. The Palestinian enclave has effectively been under an Israeli land, sea and air blockade since 2007. Hamas and other Palestinian factions have been calling for the blockade to end and have organised protests at the fence that separates the territory from Israel. Hezbollah, a powerful armed group backed by Iran, said it had launched guided rockets and artillery onto three posts in Shebaa Farms “in solidarity” with the Palestinian people. Shebaa Farms, which is claimed by Lebanon, was captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. “On the path to liberate the remaining part of our occupied Lebanese land and in solidarity with the victorious Palestinian resistance and the steadfast Palestinian people, the groups of the martyr commander Hajj Imad Moghniyeh in the Islamic Resistance carried out an attack this Sunday, October 08, 2023, targeting 3 Zionist occupation sites in the occupied Lebanese Shebaa Farms region,” Hezbollah said in a statement. The Israeli military said on Sunday it fired artillery into an area of Lebanon from where cross-border mortar fire was launched. Israel’s military said one of its drones struck a Hezbollah post in the area of Har Dov, an area in Shebaa Farms. Israel said its forces “are now attacking with artillery fire the area in Lebanon from where shooting was carried out a few minutes ago into Israeli territory”. The Israeli forces said they were “prepared for all scenarios, and will continue to protect the security of the residents of the State of Israel”. Tel Aviv has held the Shebaa Farms, a 39-square-km (15-square-mile) patch of land, since 1967. Both Syria and Lebanon claim the Shebaa Farms are Lebanese. There was no comment from the Lebanese authorities on the incident.  The United Nations peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Reuters news agency. On Saturday, it said it had enhanced its presence in southern Lebanon following developments in Israel and Gaza. Hezbollah, which effectively controls southern Lebanon, said on Saturday it was in “direct contact” with leaders of Palestinian “resistance” groups. The group said it saw Palestinian attacks on Israel as a “decisive response to Israel’s continued occupation and a message to those seeking normalisation with Israel”."

Max Ver­stap­pen hails third For­mu­la One cham­pi­onship ti­tle as ‘best’ yet,https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2023/10/8/max-verstappen-third-formula-one-championship-title-best-yet-qatar,"The 26-year-old Dutch star clinch­es his third ti­tle in a 19-lap sprint race in Qatar, with six Grands Prix to spare.","Max Verstappen has crowned a season of domination by securing his third Formula One world championship in Qatar and said it was the best yet. The Red Bull driver won his first in highlycontroversial circumstancesafter a battle with Lewis Hamilton went down to the wire in 2021, the second with15 wins in 22 racesand the third on Saturday with six Grands Prix to spare. “This one is the best one,” he told reporters after finishing second in a 19-lap sprint race in Qatar as his sole title rival and teammate Sergio Perez crashed out after 11 laps. “The first one was the most emotional one because that’s when your dreams are fulfilled in F1. “But this one has definitely been my best year for consecutive wins and stuff like that, the car itself has been probably in the best shape as well. So for me, this one is probably the one I’m the most proud of in a way, because of the consistency.” Oscar Piastri won the sprint – a rare achievement for a rookie, even if Verstappen’s title overshadowed it – and his McLaren teammate Lando Norris was third.  Verstappen won a record 10 races in a row from Miami in May to Singapore last month and has taken 13 victories from 16 grands prix. Until Singapore, when he was fifth, he had been second in the two races he had not won. Asked how many more championships he could win, Verstappen said it depended on the package but he definitely had “quite a few years in me to be able to operate at my best”. “We’ll see how long that is, to be honest,” he added. “I think it’s more about how long I want to be here. That’s different.” The 26-year-old Dutch said it was a very proud moment for him, his family and the entire team. “I don’t know how long this is going to last,” he said. “I’m enjoying the moment and I think that’s also very important. I achieved more than I could have ever even dreamed of.” Verstappen is one of only five drivers to have won three consecutive drivers’ world titles – alongside Juan Manuel Fangio, Michael Schumacher, Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton. He has also joined an elite group of three-time champions, including Jack Brabham, Niki Lauda, Nelson Piquet, Ayrton Senna and Jackie Stewart. Red Bull team boss Christian Horner hailed Verstappen as “the most competitive driver I’ve ever seen” on Saturday. “He’s up there with the very best, some of the greatest the sport has seen and I think this season has just surpassed anything we’ve seen,” Horner said.  Perez seemed capable of challenging Verstappen when he won two of the first four races of this season, but has not won since the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in April. Piastri followed up his first Grand Prix podium in Japan two weeks ago with his first victory in an F1 race, even if the sprint does not count as an official Grand Prix win. “It’s a bit of a weird feeling because it’s not a race win. It does feel a little bit strange,” he said. Both the venue in Qatar and the format are modern additions to F1. The Lusail circuit and the sprint events – which Verstappen has opposed in the past – were both added to the calendar in Verstappen’s first title year in 2021. A day before the Qatar Grand Prix race on Sunday, the sport’s governing body, the FIA, said it could mandate at least three pit stops with tyre changes. That follows concerns that the sidewalls of the Pirelli tyres have been damaged when cars run over the pointed “pyramid” kerbs used in Qatar. The track has already been narrowed at one point to stop cars running quite as wide over the kerbs. The FIA said it would take a final decision about Sunday’s race after it and Pirelli can study the tyres which were used on Saturday. For the new three-time champion, it is a question of how to balance celebrations with the reality of having to race again on Sunday. He will start on pole. “I guess quite a few sparkling waters tonight,” Verstappen said with a smile when asked how he would mark the occasion. “But I’ll be here tomorrow.”"

Suhail Shaheen, the Taliban spokesperson based in Qatar, told Al Jazeera that many people were missing and rescue operations were under way to save people trapped under the rubble in the wake of a magnitude 6.3 earthquake in Herat province. Shaheen said there was an urgent need for tents, medical and food items in the areas hit by the disaster, as he appealed to local businessmen and NGOs to come forward to help people in need. On Sunday, people attempted to dig out the dead and injured with their hands in Herat, clambering over rocks and debris. Survivors and victims were trapped under buildings that had crumbled to the ground, their faces grey with dust. One video, shared online, shows people freeing a baby girl from a collapsed building after being buried up to her neck in debris. A hand is seen cradling the baby’s torso as rescuers ease the child out of the ground. Rescuers said it was the baby’s mother. It is not clear if the mother survived. “Besides the 2,060 dead, 1,240 people are injured and 1,320 houses are completely destroyed,” said Abdul Wahid Rayan, spokesperson at the Ministry of Information and Culture. About six villages have been destroyed and hundreds of civilians have been buried under the debris, he said, calling for urgent help. The magnitude 6.3 earthquake hit 40km (24 miles) northwest of the city of Herat at about 11am on Saturday (06:30 GMT), according to the US Geological Survey (USGS). Strong aftershocks were felt in the neighbouring Badghis and Farah provinces. A rescue volunteer, who did not want to be named, from Zenda Jan – the worst affected district located in Herat – said the search and rescue teams were not properly trained and lacked modern equipment. “Unfortunately we have lost a lot of people in west of Herat in Zenda Jan and Ghorian districts,” he said. “The tragedy is very huge, we cannot define it to you in simple words. People are still trapped in the debris, they are alive, but we cannot reach them.” He urged the UN and other international organisations to provide Afghans with trained search and rescue teams, with modern equipment and rescue dogs to help find those still trapped inside.  At least a dozen teams have been scrambled to help with rescue efforts, including from the military and non-profit organizations like the Red Crescent. The United Nations migration agency has deployed four ambulances with doctors and psychosocial support counsellors to the regional hospital. At least three mobile health teams are on their way to the Zenda Jan district, which is one of the worst affected areas. The World Health Organization unit in Afghanistan said it dispatched 12 ambulances to Zendeh Jan to shift wounded people to hospitals. Doctors Without Borders set up five medical tents at Herat Regional Hospital to accommodate up to 80 patients. Authorities have treated more than 300 patients, according to the agency. Irfanullah Sharafzai, a spokesperson for the Afghan Red Crescent Society, said seven teams are busy with rescue efforts while other teams are arriving from eight nearby provinces. “A temporary camp has been set up for people who have lost their houses and need shelter for now,” Sharafzai told The Associated Press. “Whatever is in our capacity we will do for our poor and needy people at this difficult time.” In Herat city, resident Abdul Shakor Samadi said the quake was followed by at least five strong aftershocks at about noon. “All people are out of their homes,” Samadi said. “Houses, offices and shops are all empty and there are fears of more earthquakes. My family and I were inside our home. I felt the quake.” His family began shouting and ran outside, afraid to return indoors. The USGS said the quake was followed by three strong aftershocks – magnitude 6.3, 5.9 and 5.5 – as well as weaker shocks. The country’s national disaster authority said on Saturday the earthquake had killed about 100 people. Later on Saturday, the United Nations gave a preliminary figure of 320 deaths. However, it later said the figure was still being verified, while the Red Crescent said 500 people were killed. Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban-appointed deputy prime minister for economic affairs, offered his condolences to the victims’ families and those injured in the quake. Afghan cricket star Rashid Khan said he was donating all his Cricket World Cup fees to help Herat’s earthquake survivors. “Soon, we will be launching a fundraising campaign to call upon those who can support the people in need,” he told his 1.9 million followers on X, previously known as Twitter. In June 2022, a powerful earthquake struck a rugged, mountainous region of eastern Afghanistan, flattening stone and mud-brick homes. It was Afghanistan’s deadliest earthquake in two decades, killing at least 1,000 people and injuring about 1,500."

Russia’s defence ministry said it shot down two Ukrainian S-200 anti-aircraft missiles over the Moscow-annexed Crimean Peninsula. The ministry issued two near-identical Telegram posts on Saturday night saying that Kyiv had “attempted a terrorist attack” at 6pm (15:00 GMT) and 10pm (19:00GMT) Moscow time with an S-200 anti-aircraft missile that had been “converted to an attack version”. Another Ukrainian drone was also shot down near Moscow early on Saturday, the Russian TASS news agency reported, adding that it appeared to cause no damage or injuries. In Russia’s Belgorod, local authorities said three Ukrainian Tochka-U missiles were destroyed over the border region and that shelling by Kyiv’s forces had killed one person who was on the street at the time of the attack. In Ukraine, a member of Russia’s governing United Russia Party was killed by a car bomb in the Russian-held town of Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region, according to officials. Vladimir Malov died in hospital, the officials said. In the Ukrainian town of Hroza in the Kharkiv region, local residents began burying victims of aRussian missile strikethat killed some 50 people on Friday. Representatives from the United Nations Monitoring Mission in Ukraine told The Associated Press news agency that conversations with local residents and survivors indicate “that virtually all those killed were civilians and that the target itself, a busy village cafe and store, was also clearly civilian”. Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Russia’s Chechnya region and a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, proposed that a presidential election due next March should either be postponed due to the war in Ukraine or limited to one candidate. “I propose now, while the ‘special military operation’ is under way, to unanimously decide that we will have one candidate in the elections – Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin,” Kadyrov was quoted as saying. “Or temporarily call off the elections, because there’s no one else who could defend our country today.” A United States think tank said rail traffic along the North Korea-Russia border spiked this week to the highest in years, suggesting arms supplies by Pyongyang to Moscow after the leaders of the two countries discussed deeper military cooperation. The Center for Strategic and International Studies said satellite imagery showed an “unprecedented” 73 or so freight cars at Tumangang Rail Station in the North Korean border city of Rason. The traffic was far greater than that observed in the past five years, including pre-pandemic levels, it said. Denmark’s defence ministry said it aims to restart ammunition production after a 55-year gap to ensure its domestic supplies as Russia’s war in Ukraine creates increased demand for military hardware across Europe."

The 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck 40km (24 miles) west of the city of Herat at about 11am on Saturday (06:30 GMT), with strong aftershocks felt in the neighbouring Badghis and Farah provinces. The Afghan Ministry of Defence in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, said the tremors killed more than 100 people and injured more than 500. A situation report from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs added that there were unconfirmed estimates that as many as 320 people had died. “Partners and local authorities anticipate the number of casualties to increase as search and rescue efforts continue amid reports that some people may be trapped under collapsed buildings,” the OCHA said.  In Herat city, resident Abdul Shakor Samadi said the quake was followed by at least five strong tremors at about noon on Saturday (07:30 GMT). “All people are out of their homes,” Samadi said. “Houses, offices and shops are all empty and there are fears of more earthquakes. My family and I were inside our home, I felt the quake.” His family began shouting and ran outside, afraid to return indoors. The United States Geological Survey said the quake’s epicentre was about 40km northwest of Herat city. It was followed by three very strong aftershocks, measuring magnitude 6.3, 5.9 and 5.5 as well as lesser shocks. Disaster authority spokesperson Mohammad Abdullah Jan said that the quake and aftershocks damaged homes in four villages in the Zenda Jan district in Herat province. There were also reports of widespread damage to houses in the Farah and Badges provinces. The World Health Organization in Afghanistan said it dispatched 12 ambulances to Zenda Jan to evacuate casualties to hospitals. “As deaths & casualties from the earthquake continue to be reported, teams are in hospitals assisting treatment of wounded & assessing additional needs,” the UN agency said on X. “WHO-supported ambulances are transporting those affected, most of them women and children.” Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban-appointed deputy prime minister for economic affairs, expressed his condolences to the dead and injured in Herat and Badghis. The Taliban urged local organisations to reach earthquake-hit areas as soon as possible to help take the injured to hospital, provide shelter for the homeless and deliver food to survivors. They said security agencies should use all their resources and facilities to rescue people trapped under debris. “We ask our wealthy compatriots to give any possible cooperation and help to our afflicted brothers,” the Taliban said on X. In June 2022, a powerful earthquake struck a rugged, mountainous region of eastern Afghanistan, flattening stone and mud-brick homes. The quake was Afghanistan’s deadliest in two decades, killing at least 1,000 people and injuring about 1,500."
Fears of a ground in­va­sion of Gaza grow as Is­rael vows ‘mighty vengeance’,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/7/world-is-watching-fears-grow-of-a-massive-gaza-invasion-by-israel,The Is­raeli mil­i­tary is still fight­ing with Hamas in parts of south­ern Is­rael af­ter it launched an at­tack there.,"Fears of a huge ground invasion of Gaza are growing after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to turn the besieged Palestinian enclave into a “deserted island” in response tothe worst attackhis country has suffered in decades. The pledge came after gunmen from Hamas, which governs Gaza, rampaged through Israeli towns and killed at least 250 people on Saturday whileretreating with soldier and civilian hostagesin the deadliest day of violence for Israel since the Yom Kippur War 50 years ago. The Israeli military responded with devastating retaliatory strikes on Gaza,killing more than 230 Palestiniansin the blockaded strip. Israeli forces were still bombing Gaza and fighting with Hamas gunmen in parts of southern Israel in the early hours of Sunday and a spokesman for the military said the situation in the country was not totally under control. Hamas said its unprecedented offensive by land, air and sea was in response to the desecration of the Al Aqsa Mosque as well as Israeli atrocities against Palestinians over the decades. These include the 16-year blockade of Gaza, Israeli raids inside West Bank cities over the past year, increasing attacks by settlers on Palestinians as well as the growth of illegal settlements. Mohammed Deif, a Hamas military commander, said the time has come “for the enemy to understand… they cannot keep going without consequences”. Hamas leaders said the assault that began in Gaza would spread to the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem. Netanyahu, who has declared a “state of war” and called up military reservists, promised to fight Hamas to the bitter end. He told the 2.3 Palestinians in Gaza who are under an Israeli land, air and sea blockade to leave the territory immediately. “We will take mighty vengeance for this black day,” the Israeli leader said in a televised address. “We will take revenge for all the young people who lost their lives. We will target all of Hamas’s positions. We will turn Gaza into a deserted island. To the citizens of Gaza, I say. You must leave now. We will target each and every corner of the strip.”  In Gaza, residents spent the night in darkness and uncertainty as Israel cut power to the territory and intensified its bombardment of the densely populated enclave. The attacks flattened residential buildings in giant explosions, including a 14-story tower that held dozens of apartments as well as Hamas offices in central Gaza City. Around 3am local time (00:00 GMT), a loudspeaker atop a mosque in Gaza City blared a stark warning to residents of nearby apartment buildings: Evacuate immediately. Just minutes later, an Israeli airstrike reduced one five-story building to ashes. Gaza’s residents carried their dead and wounded into crumbling and overcrowded hospitals with severe shortages of medical supplies and equipment. The health ministry said 232 people had been killed and at least 1,700 wounded. Saleh al-Arouri, the deputy chief of Hamas’s political bureau, told Al Jazeera that Hamas was holding alarge number of Israeli captives, including senior military officials. He said Hamas had enough captives to make Israel free all Palestinians in its jails. “We managed to kill and capture many Israeli soldiers,” he said. While world leaders called for restraint, many observers predicted a major ground assault on Gaza is likely in the works. “There’s going to be a second act and that is an invasion of Gaza, and I think larger than 2014 when Israel called up 80,000 reserves,” said Yonah Jeremy Bob, a military analyst for the Jerusalem Post. “Within a day or two, Israel will have a massive force that will be able to overwhelm Hamas forces in Gaza,” Bob told Al Jazeera.  Danny Danon, a member of Israel’s Knesset or parliament, said a response against Hamas is coming. “The people in Gaza will have to take into consideration they will have to pay a price. Unlike Hamas, we have no intention of hurting civilians, but when we hunt Hamas we will be strong, we will be efficient, and we will do whatever it takes to hunt them down,” Danon told Al Jazeera. “We will not sit idly by after more than 200 Israeli civilians were butchered, massacred today on our Jewish holiday.” Meanwhile, in southern Israel, residents had yet to be given the all-clear to leave shelters where they hid from the assailants since the early hours. In the city of Sderot, Israeli forces were attempting to demolish a police station that had been seized by Palestinian fighters earlier in the day. “It seems the Israeli forces are trying to bulldoze that building to try and avoid any boobytraps. It is not yet clear whether any gunmen are left inside,” said Al Jazeera’s Willem Marx, reporting from West Jerusalem. “We heard from Israeli military today that all options remain on the table, when asked if this could end in a ground invasion of Gaza. We know that large numbers of reservists, thousands of them, have been called up and large numbers of heavy weaponry, including tanks, have been seen on roads heading south towards Gaza,” he added.  United States President Joe Biden decried the “unconscionable” assault by Hamas fighters and pledged to ensure Israel has “what it needs to defend itself”. He told Netanyahu that the US “stands with the people of Israel”. “Israel has the right to defend itself and its people, full stop. There’s never a justification for terrorist attacks and my administration’s support for Israeli’s security is rock solid and unwavering,” said Biden. Biden also warned Israel’s enemies that “this is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage. The world is watching”. Egypt is in talks with Saudi Arabia and Jordan in a bid to defuse Palestinian-Israeli tensions, the Egyptian foreign ministry said. Across the Middle East, there were demonstrations in support of Hamas with Israeli and US flags set on fire and marchers waving Palestinian flags in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. In Iran, Israel’s regional archenemy, members of parliament opened their session on Saturday by chanting, “Death to Israel” and “Israel will be doomed, Palestine will be the conqueror”. Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said, “Today’s operation created a new page in the field of resistance and armed operation against occupiers.” In Lebanon’s Palestinian refugee camps, hundreds also took to the streets to celebrate the Hamas operation. Ali Abunimah, the co-founder of The Electronic Intifada website, said 80 years of Israeli repression and “massacres” in Palestine was the reason behind the violence carried out on Saturday. “The Palestinian people are struggling justly for their liberation. An Indigenous people fighting for their existence will fight back with great motivation to decades of living under the boot of this colonial regime whose brutality is being highlighted by the response from Israeli leaders,” he told Al Jazeera.

As Israel and Palestinian group Hamas trade blows in the latest chapter of theirrapidly escalating conflict, a surreal scene unfolded in Tel Aviv on Saturday evening. The streets and beaches of the normally buzzing city were empty save for a few bewildered tourists. A Swiss couple wandered around, confused. “Is everything closed because it’s Saturday, or because it’s wartime?” one of them asked. They wanted to find a spot to grab a quick bite near Jaffa and were not sure why everything was so eerily quiet. In front of a closed cafe in the south of the city, a few Israelis sat together, smoking. “I’ve got to get some air and see people with all this stress,” said one to the other. They did not seem to know each other — they were strangers brought together by a shared anxiety. Early Saturday morning, Hamas had launched a surprise attack on Israel. Thousands of rockets were launched, triggering sirens as far north as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and dozens of armed fighters entered southern Israel from the besieged Gaza Strip. So far, at least 70 Israelis have been killed in the attacks by Hamas, which said it has also taken a“big number” of hostagesinto the Gaza Strip. Israeli forces launched air raids on Gaza, withabout 200 Palestinians killedso far in the densely populated enclave. Several hundreds have been injured. Israeli bombs targeted two high-rise buildings in Gaza. The number of Palestinian and Israeli casualties is expected to rise as the fighting continues. With the uncertainty surrounding the hostage count and casualties in southern Israel, most people in Tel Aviv are staying in their apartments. But some, like the Israelis outside the cafe, were driven outdoors by the stress. In a small park, others reminisced about the 1973 October War in which Israel had to confront Egypt and Syria, a war whose 50th anniversary was commemorated a day earlier, on October 6. Indoors, Tel Avivis are glued to their screens, waiting anxiously to hear from relatives and friends to make sure they’re safe. Football games have been cancelled, as was the International Film Festival in the northern city of Haifa, approximately 150km (93 miles) from Gaza. Meanwhile, the weeklyprotests against Israel’s judicial overhaulwere paused for the second time since they began in February."

The attack on Palestine Tower on Saturday came hours after Hamas, the group running the besieged Gaza Strip, launched a multi-pronged attack by firing thousands of rockets and sending fighters inside Israel. The hit was caught live on camera as Al Jazeera’s Youmna ElSayed was reporting from another building nearby.  “The building was totally destroyed and brought to the ground,” she said afterwards. “Looking at all the buildings adjacent to it, you can imagine the amount of destruction that is in [the vicinity].” There was no immediate information about any casualties. Israel’s air force said in a statement its fighter jets hit two high-rise buildings in Gaza, alleging they housed Hamas “military infrastructure”. It was not immediately clear if one of those buildings the air force was referring to was the Palestine Tower. Israel has a track record of conducting hits on residential buildings and towers located within the Gaza Strip, one of the world’s most densely populated areas. These actions, referred to by the Israeli army as “precision strikes” targeting armed groups, frequently occur in densely inhabited areas and have resulted in civilian casualties. During an 11-day conflict in Gaza in 2021, Israel targeted four towers, causing the destruction of three of them, including one that housed the offices of Al Jazeera and The Associated Press. London-based human rights group Amnesty International has previously raised concerns over Israel’s military tactics, asserting that recurring attacks on residential buildings in Gaza demonstrated a disregard for the wellbeing of Palestinian civilians, and could potentially constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity.

The fighting is still on,” Saleh al-Arouri, deputy chief of Hamas’s political bureau, told Al Jazeera on Saturday. “Our detainees in [Israeli] prisons, their freedom is looming large. What we have in our hands will release all our prisoners. The longer fighting continues, the higher the number of prisoners will become,” added al-Arouri, who said senior officers were among those captured, but did not provide any figures. According to the latest figures by Addameer, a prisoners’ rights NGO, nearly 5,200 Palestinians are in Israeli jails, including 33 women, 170 minors and more than 1,200 placed under administrative detention. The Israeli army has acknowledged soldiers and commanders have been killed and prisoners of war have been taken. It has not given any figures. Hamas, the group running the besieged Gaza Strip, launched the biggest operation on Israel in years on Saturday, killing dozens of people and wounding hundreds after fighters crossed into Israel under the cover of a barrage of rockets fired from Gaza. Meanwhile, Hamas social media accounts posted footage of what were said to be Israeli captives moved alive into the Gaza Strip.  The surprise operation from Gaza came on the heels of the killing of four Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, widespread Israeli settler attacks, especially inHuwara, near Nablus and increased tensions at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem. The Israeli military launched air raids on the Gaza Strip, killing at least 198 Palestinians and wounding hundreds of others, according to the enclave’s ministry of health. Speaking to Al Jazeera, al-Arouri said the group is engaged in a battle for freedom. “This is not a [hit-and-run] operation; we started an all-out battle. We expect fighting to continue and the fighting front to expand. We have one prime target: our freedom and the freedom of our holy sites,” he told Al Jazeera. Al-Arouri said Palestinians have a right to freedom, to fight the Israeli occupation and to safeguard their holy sites. “We will continue to fight until we are rewarded with victory, freedom and independence,” he said. As observers noted that a land invasion by Israel could be imminent, Hamas said it is ready for “the worst-case scenario”. “All scenarios are now possible and we are ready for an [Israeli] land invasion,” he added. Al-Arouri also said that Israel had been planning to launch an attack on the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Earlier, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country is “at war”, while Palestinian officials say ending the Israeli occupation of their territory is the only guarantee for “security, stability and peace” in the region. The US, meanwhile, said it will work to ensure Israel “has what it needs to defend itself” and the UK, EU and Ukraine have condemned Hamas’s operation in Israel."

Hosts In­dia open Crick­et World Cup quest with block­buster against Aus­tralia,https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2023/10/7/india-vs-australia-icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-preview,Two-time win­ners In­dia face five-time cham­pi­ons Aus­tralia in a mouth­wa­ter­ing one-day in­ter­na­tion­al in Chen­nai.,"Who:India vs Australia Where:MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai, India When:Sunday, October 8, 2pm local time (08:30 GMT) It’s a blockbuster opener for theCricket World Cup hostsIndia, as the two-time winners take on five-time champions Australia. Indiawon the World Cupin 1983 and 2011 – the last time the tournament was played in India. Since then, they have only won one ICC event – the 2013 Champions Trophy in England – and India are looking to end their trophy drought at home. Australia are the most successful ODI team, having won the 1987, 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2015 competitions. They are the only side to win three successive ODI titles. Jasprit Bumrah andMohammed Sirajare expected to lead India’s bowling attack on Sunday, with wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav and left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja as automatic choices. All-rounder Hardik Pandya fits in as the third pacer. India’s batting lineup is the strongest on paper and consists of the veritable superstars of world cricket.Virat Kohliis on the verge of breaking Sachin Tendulkar’s all-time ODI centuries’ record, while skipper Rohit Sharma wants to make up for missing out on the 2011 tournament. “In the last few games [against Australia and at theAsia Cup], we have been challenged across different conditions and against different opposition,” Sharma said after the third ODI against Australia two weeks ago when India won the series 2-1. “We have played really well in these games. We have a good squad and we understand how we want to use it during the World Cup. It will be about keeping our minds and bodies fresh across the next 1 1/2 months.”  Australian batsmen, however, have a rich experience of Indian conditions, and almost all of them are linked up with Indian Premier League franchises. David Warner, Steve Smith, Cameron Green, Mitchell Marsh, Marcus Stoinis and Glenn Maxwell spend a lot of time playing in Indian conditions. Pacers Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc will lead the Australia bowling, while wrist-spinner Adam Zampa has enjoyed success in Indian conditions – 27 wickets in 16 matches at an average of 30.77. Australia skipper Pat Cummins said on Saturday his team are content to go about their game “quietly”, in contrast to the ultra-aggressive style of earlier Australian sides. “Our guys are pretty chilled out, so I am always proud saying the players out there in the field are similar to who they are off the field,” he said.  India will be missing batsman Shubman Gill, who has reportedly tested positive for dengue fever, so Ishan Kishan will likely open the batting alongside the captain, Sharma. India’s predicted XI:Rohit Sharma (c), Ishan Kishan, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Jasprit Bumrah. Australia are waiting on a fitness check for Marcus Stoinis ahead of their Sunday opener. The the all-rounder pulled up with a sore hamstring in the first game of Australia’s 2-1 series defeat in India last month. “Stoinis is still touch and go,” Cummins said on Saturday. “He is going to have a run this afternoon. Probably will have to jump to through a few hoops and we’ll see.” Australia’s predicted XI:David Warner, Mitchell Marsh, Steve Smith, Marnus Labuschagne, Glenn Maxwell, Cameron Green, Alex Carey, Adam Zampa, Mitchell Starc, Sean Abbott, Pat Cummins (c). A total of 149 matches have taken place between India and Australia in the ODI format. Australia have won 83 matches, while India have won 56 matches. Ten games ended without a result."

Israel said Hamas has declared war as itsarmy mobilised and air force launched strikeson Gaza with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promising harsh retaliation. Here is international reactionto the fightingso far: Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit urged “an immediate halt to military operations in Gaza” and “the cycle of armed confrontation between the two sides”. “Israel’s continued implementation of violent and extremist policies is a time bomb depriving the region of any serious opportunity for stability in the foreseeable future.” UN Security Council chair Brazil announced it will call an emergency meeting of the body to address the escalating violence and it urged restraint. “The Brazilian government condemns the series of bombings and ground attacks carried out today in Israel starting from the Gaza Strip,” Brazil’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement, urging parties to “avoid escalating the situation”. “Belgium strongly condemns the massive rocket attacks against Israeli civilians. Violence and terror only perpetuates suffering and hinders the path to dialogue. Our thoughts are with all those affected. We are monitoring the situation closely,” Foreign Affairs Minister Hadja Lahbib wrote on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.  Beijing said it was “deeply concerned” by the weekend’s dramatic escalation of violence between Israel and the Palestinians, urging all sides to show “calm”. “China is deeply concerned about the current escalation of tension and violence between Palestine and Israel,” Beijing’s foreign ministry said, adding it “calls on all parties concerned to remain calm and exercise restraint, cease fire immediately, protect civilians and prevent further deterioration of the situation”. “The attack conducted from the Gaza Strip is a deplorable act of terrorism against the State of Israel and the civilian population,” President Petr Pavel said in a statement. “The rocket attacks and the infiltration of Hamas commandos into Israel will block any efforts for a peaceful solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict for a long time.” “I unequivocally condemn the attack carried out by Hamas terrorists against Israel… Israel has the right to defend itself against such heinous attacks,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted on X.  Foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said: “We unequivocally condemn the attacks by Hamas. This horrific violence must stop immediately. Terrorism and violence solve nothing.” Egypt warned of “grave consequences” from an escalation in tensions between Israel and the Palestinians in a statement from the foreign ministry carried by the state news agency. It called for “exercising maximum restraint and avoiding exposing civilians to further danger”. Egypt’s Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukri also held a call with European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell to discuss developments, stating that both sides should exercise restraint to avoid serious risks. French President Emmanuel Macron condemned the “terrorist attacks” against Israel. “I strongly condemn the terrorist attacks which are currently hitting Israel. I express my full solidarity with the victims, and their families and those close to them,” Macron wrote on X. The French embassy in Israel on Saturday described the attacks as “inadmissible terrorist attacks”. “Horrified by the developments coming from the south of the country. These terrorist attacks are inadmissible and must be condemned by everyone. We stand side by side alongside Israel and Israelis,” the French embassy wrote on X.  Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi warned of the “volatility” of the situation, “particularly in light of what cities and areas of the West Bank are witnessing of Israeli attacks and violations against the Palestinian people”. Fatalities in the occupied West Bank have reached a scale unseen in years. Jordan and Egypt were the first two countries in the region to agree peace deals with Israel. “Terrifying news reaches us today from #Israel. We are deeply shocked by the rocket fire from Gaza and the escalating violence. Germany condemns these attacks by Hamas and stands by Israel,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on social media. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Berlin “firmly condemns the terrorist attacks from Gaza against Israel”. Baerbock said Hamas “contributes to the intensification of violence”, adding “violence and rockets aimed at innocent people must stop immediately”. “Greece strongly condemns today’s launch of heavy rocket attacks from Gaza against Israel. Greece stands with Israel and is deeply concerned by this unacceptable escalation of violence,” the Greek Foreign Ministry posted on X.  The Lebanese armed group Hezbollah issued a statement saying it was closely following the situation in Gaza and was in “direct contact with the leadership of the Palestinian resistance”. Following events involving Gaza fighters who fired a barrage of rockets into Israel, the statement added it was a “decisive response to Israel’s continued occupation and a message tothose seeking normalisation with Israel“. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his country stood “in solidarity with Israel at this difficult hour”. “Deeply shocked by the news of terrorist attacks in Israel,” Modi said. An adviser to Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei said Iran supported the Palestinians’ attack, the semi-official ISNA news site reported. “We congratulate the Palestinian fighters,” it quoted adviser Rahim Safavi as saying. “We will stand by the Palestinian fighters until the liberation of Palestine and Jerusalem.” Iran’s foreign ministry said attacks by its ally Hamas were proof of the Palestinians’ increased confidence in the face of Israel’s occupation. “In this operation, the element of surprise and other combined methods were used, which show the Palestinian people’s confidence in the face of the occupiers,” ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said. The attacks “proved that the Zionist regime is more vulnerable than ever and that the initiative is in the hands of Palestinian youth,” government spokesperson Ali Bahadori-Jahromi told state news agency IRNA.  Italy said it backed “Israel’s right to defend itself” against the “brutal attack” by Hamas. The government said it “condemned in the strongest terms the terror and the violence under way against innocent civilians”. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country is at “war” and he is confident it “will win”. “Our enemy will pay a price the type of which it has never known,” Netanyahu said in a video statement. Japan condemned rocket launches and cross-border attacks by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups into Israeli territory, the foreign ministry said. “Japan urges all parties to exercise utmost restraint to prevent further harm.” Kuwait expressed its “grave concern” over developments between Israel and the Palestinians, blaming Israel for what it called its “blatant attacks”. The foreign ministry in a statement called on the international community to “stop the provocative practices by the occupation” and the “policy of expanding settlements”. “The Kingdom of Morocco expresses its deep concern at the deterioration of the situation and the outbreak of military action in the Gaza Strip, and condemns attacks against civilians wherever they may be,” a foreign ministry statement said. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization condemned “terrorist attacks by Hamas against NATO partner Israel”, a spokesman for the defence alliance said. “Our thoughts are with the victims and all those affected. Terrorism is a fundamental threat to free societies, and Israel has the right to defend itself,” said spokesman Dylan White.  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said that the Palestinian people have the right to defend themselves against the “terror of settlers and occupation troops”, the official news agency WAFA quoted him as saying. He was speaking at an emergency meeting held in Ramallah with a number of top officials from the Palestinian Authority. “I strongly condemn Hamas’ ongoing attacks on Israel. This baseless aggression and acts of violence, especially against civilians, are unacceptable. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by these terrible events,” Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau wrote on X. Qatar’s foreign ministry issued a statement saying Israel alone was responsible for the ongoing escalation of violence with the Palestinian people. It called on both sides to exercise utmost restraint and calls on the international community to prevent Israel from using these events as an excuse to launch a disproportionate war against Palestinian civilians in Gaza. Russia said it is in contact with Israel, the Palestinians and Arab countries in connection with the escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Interfax news agency reported, citing Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov. “It goes without saying that we always call for restraint,” he added. The ministry called for an “immediate cessation of violence” between Israel and the Palestinians, the state news agency reported. “We are following the unprecedented developments between a number of Palestinian factions and Israel occupation forces which has led to a high level of violence on a number of fronts”. Spain’s acting Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said on X that he condemned the attacks from Gaza against Israel. “We strongly condemn the very serious terrorist attacks from Gaza against Israel. “Overwhelmed by this indiscriminate violence. All our solidarity (is) with the victims.” Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan called on Israelis and Palestinians to act with restraint and refrain from hostile acts that could exacerbate the situation. “We call for restraint from all parties,” Erdogan said at a congress for his ruling AK Party in Ankara. “They must refrain from aggressive acts,” he said. President Volodymr Zelenskyy condemned what he called a “terror attack” on Israel and said Israel’s right to defend itself “cannot be doubted”. Ukraine’s foreign ministry condemned what it described as “ongoing terrorist attacks” on Israel. “Ukraine strongly condemns the ongoing terrorist attacks against Israel, including rocket attacks against the civilian population in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv,” the ministry said on X. “We express our support for Israel in its right to defend itself and its people.” “The UAE calls for the exercise of maximum restraint and an immediate ceasefire to avoid serious repercussions,” the foreign ministry said. “The UAE has expressed its sincere condolences to all the victims of the recent crisis.” Abu Dhabi normalised relations with Israel in 2020 under theUS-backed Abraham Accords, along with Bahrain and Morocco. The UK also criticised the attack by Hamas on Israel on Saturday, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said. “The UK unequivocally condemns the horrific attacks by Hamas on Israeli civilians. The UK will always support Israel’s right to defend itself,” Cleverly said in a post on social media.  UN Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland said: “This is a dangerous precipice and I appeal to all to pull back from the brink.” UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Tuerk said: “This attack is having a horrific impact on Israeli civilians… Civilians must never be the target of attack.” The United Nations Security Council is due to meet on Sunday. “Secretary-General [Antonio Guterres] is deeply concerned for the civilian population and urges maximum restraint. Civilians must be respected and protected in accordance with international humanitarian law at all times,” UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. The US condemned “the appalling Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel”. “President [Joe Biden] will continue to receive updates and White House officials remain in close contact with Israeli partners,” the White House said in a statement. “The United States unequivocally condemns the unprovoked attacks by Hamas terrorists against Israeli civilians. There is never any justification for terrorism. We stand firmly with the government and people of Israel and extend our condolences for the Israeli lives lost in these attacks.” US military chief Lloyd Austin said: “Over the coming days the Department of Defense will work to ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself and protect civilians from indiscriminate violence and terrorism.” Biden warned “against any other party hostile to Israel seeking advantage in this situation”, adding he had spoken to Netanyahu. Venezuela’s government expressed its “deep concern” over the clashes. In a statement on X, formerly Twitter, it said the fighting was “the result of the impossibility of the Palestinian people to find in multilateral international legality a space to assert their historic rights”. Yemen In Yemen, Houthi rebels who control the capital Sanaa expressed their support for “the heroic jihadist operation”. In a statement published on the website of the Houthi-controlled SABA news agency, the Iran-aligned group said the attack “revealed the weakness, fragility and impotence” of Israel. It added that this operation “is a battle of dignity, pride, and defence”. "
In­dia gift­ed Asian Games crick­et gold over Afghanistan by rank­ing rule,https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2023/10/7/india-gifted-asian-games-cricket-gold-over-afghanistan-by-ranking-rule,In­dia were de­clared win­ners of the fi­nal un­der an Asian Games-spe­cif­ic rule af­ter the game was washed out by rain.,"Gifted an armchair ride byAsian Gamesorganisers, India have taken gold in the men’s cricket as the rain-hit T20 final against Afghanistan was decided by the superpower’s superior global ranking. Afghanistan, ranked 10th in the ICC’s T20 rankings versus world number one India, were left with silver on Saturday and powerless to do anything about it after rain halted the match when they were 112 for five after 18.2 overs of the first innings. With India unable to bat a minimum five overs, play was abandoned soon after 5pm local time (09:00 GMT), leaving Ruturaj Gaikwad’s team to celebrate victory by default. Deciding results based purely on teams’ global rankings is almost unheard of in cricket, let alone for finals in major tournaments. Most allow spare days so that deciders can be completed if rain washes out play in the original match. If no spare days are provided, a winner is generally declared via tie-breaking criteria based on a team’s performances within the tournament they are playing. Twenty20 cricket has been played at the Asian Games twice before, at Guangzhou 2010 and Incheon 2014, with Bangladesh and then Sri Lanka crowned men’s winners. Afghanistan were runners-up both times, but India did not take part. The rankings rule also helped India’s gold medal-winning women’s team reach the semifinals after rain washed out their quarterfinal against Malaysia. India went on to beat Sri Lanka by 19 runs to be crowned women’s champions last week. Rain also hit the men’s bronze medal playoff won by Bangladesh against Pakistan but held off long enough to at least ensure a contest between the teams. It turned out to be a thriller as a last-ball four from Rakibul Hasan secured the win, the Bangladeshis having chased down 65 runs in five overs in a victory target adjusted by the Duckworth-Lewis method. The chase began disastrously, with Pakistan quick Arshad Iqbal removing Bangladesh opener Zakir Hasan and captain Saif Hassan for ducks in the first three balls. But Afif Hossain (20) steadied the innings with number four Yasir Ali (34), who went on a slogging spree to drive Bangladesh to the brink of victory. Needing 20 runs in the last over, Yasir smashed 16 of them, including two sixes, in the first four balls before being bowled by Sufiyan Muqeem. Rakibal then whacked Muqeem to the boundary on the last ball to condemn Pakistan to a medalless tournament. "

The growing casualty toll on Saturday came after the Palestinian group running the Gaza Strip launched thelargest attack on Israelin years, infiltrating areas in the south of the country following a barrage of thousands of rockets fired from the besieged territory. Israel’s national rescue service said at least 250 people were killed and hundreds wounded, making it the deadliest attack in Israel in years. An unknown number of Israeli soldiers and civilians were also seized and taken into Gaza. Hamas and Israel said late on Saturday that gun battles were raging in dozens of areas inside Israeli territory. Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant warned Hamas it made a “grave mistake” in launching the attack, which began at 6:30am local time (03:30 GMT) and involved barrages of rockets fired from multiple locations in Gaza as well as fighters infiltrating Israel by land, sea and air. “Citizens of Israel, we are at war. The enemy will pay an unprecedented price,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video message from military headquarters in Tel Aviv. Israel’s military launched a series of air raids on Gaza in response to the attack. “Dozens of [Israeli military] fighter jets are currently striking a number of targets belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation in the Gaza Strip,” it said. Mohammed Deif, a senior Hamas military commander, said the rocket fire marked the start of “Operation Al-Aqsa Flood”, and he called on Palestinians everywhere to fight the Israeli occupation. “We’ve decided to say enough is enough,” Deif said as he urged all Palestinians to confront Israel. “This is the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on Earth,” he said in an audio message. Israel’s military told Israelis living around the Gaza Strip to stay in their homes and warned Hamas would pay a “heavy price for its actions”. Israeli media reported Palestinian fighters opened fire on passers-by in the town of Sderot, in southern Israel, and footage circulating on social media appeared to show uniformed Palestinians engaged in clashes. Another video on social media appeared to show a burning Israeli tank surrounded by jubilant Palestinians. Israeli warplanes started to pound locations in Gaza – in what the military called “Operation Iron Swords” – and Israeli soldiers were engaged in ground fighting in several locations around the besieged Palestinian enclave. “Right now we’re fighting. We’re fighting in certain locations around the Gaza Strip… Our forces are now fighting on the ground,” Israel’s army spokesman Richard Hecht told reporters. Witnesses in Gaza heard loud explosions. Enas Keshta, a resident of Rafah in southern Gaza, said Palestinians are looking at a “tough night” ahead as Israeli attacks on the blockaded enclave continue. “The situation here in Gaza is not good at all. I can assure you that we are not ready, and we have a tough night waiting for us,” she told Al Jazeera. “No place is safe.” Widespread shock and fear abounds in Gaza. “We have been as surprised and frightened as the [occupation] since the operation began,” said Munir Nasser, a Gaza grocery vendor. “We haven’t seen footage of Palestinians breaching the occupied towns and villages beyond the barriers like this before.”  The outbreak of major fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian fighters comes after weeks of growing tensions along Israel’s volatile border with Gaza, and months of deadly clashes in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. At least 247 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces so far this year, while 32 Israelis and two foreign nationals have been killed in previous Palestinian attacks. Tor Wennesland, United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, condemned “the multi-front assault against” Israeli towns and cities near Gaza, which he called “heinous attacks targeting civilians”. “These events have resulted in horrific scenes of violence and many Israeli fatalities and injuries, with many believed to be kidnapped inside the Strip. These are heinous attacks targeting civilians and must stop immediately,” Wennesland said in a statement. “I am deeply concerned for the well-being of all civilians. I am in close contact with all concerned to urge maximum restraint and call on all sides to protect civilians,” he said. “This is a dangerous precipice and I appeal to all to pull back from the brink.”  In a statement posted on the Telegram messaging app, Hamas called on “the resistance fighters in the West Bank” as well as “our Arab and Islamic nations” to join the fight. Saleh al-Arouri, an exiled Hamas leader, said “Operation Al-Aqsa Flood” was a response “to the crimes of the occupation” and Palestinian fighters were defending their sacred site in occupied East Jerusalem. Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement, which was founded in 1982 to fight the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, said in a statement it was following the events in Gaza closely and was in “direct contact with the leadership of the Palestinian resistance”. Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas, told fellow Arab countries that Israel cannot provide protection despite recent diplomatic rapprochements. “We say to all countries, including our Arab brothers, that this entity, which cannot protect itself in the face of resistors, cannot provide you with any protection,” he said. “All the normalisation agreements that you signed with that entity cannot resolve this [Palestinian] conflict.” In a speech broadcast on Hamas-run Al-Aqsa television, Haniyeh added: “We are on the verge of a great victory and a clear conquest on the Gaza front. Enough is enough, the cycle of intifadas [uprisings] and revolutions in the battle to liberate our land and our prisoners languishing in occupation [Israeli] prisons must be completed.”"
Colom­bians held over Ecuador pres­i­den­tial can­di­date’s mur­der slain in jail,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/7/colombians-held-over-ecuador-presidential-candidates-murder-slain-in-jail,Ecuador’s pres­i­dent pledges to get to bot­tom of killings in prison of six Colom­bian sus­pects in high-pro­file mur­der.,"Six Colombian inmates killed in a prison in Ecuador were all suspects in the murder of the country’s anticorruption presidential candidateFernando Villavicencio earlier this year, Ecuadorian authorities have confirmed. The killings took place on Friday in Litoral Penitentiary in Guayaquil, Ecuador’s largest city, the attorney general’s office said. The SNAI prisons agency said in a statement that the six men who were killed were Colombian nationals. They “are of Colombian nationality and were accused of the murder of the former presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio”, the prison authority said. Ecuador’s government condemned the prison killings and President Guillermo Lasso pledged in a message on social media that there would be “neither complicity nor cover-up” in getting to the bottom ofwho killed the suspects in the Villavicencio case. “Here, the truth will be known,” Lasso said. Lasso also said he was temporarily calling off a visit to Seoul and returning from a trip to New York, where he had arrived on Thursday, to handle the incident.   [Unofficial translation:Following the information about the six crimes that occurred in the Deprivation of Liberty Centre No. 1, in Guayaquil, I have ordered an immediate meeting of the Security Cabinet. In the next few hours, I will return to Ecuador to attend to this emergency. Neither complicity nor cover-up, here the truth will be known.] The Ecuadorian government has said it is determined to identify those behind the murder of Villavicencio, a prominent journalist-turned-politician who was gunned down on August 9 as he was leaving a campaign rally in northern Quito ahead of first-round voting.  Villavicencio told local media before his killing that an “emissary” of a gang leader in Ecuador had contacted him and warned him to stop mentioningthe Los Choneros gang during his campaigning. Officials have blamed Villavicencio’s murder on organised crime. Guayaquil is a key port city that has become one of Ecuador’s increasingly bloody centres of a turf war between rival drug-trafficking gangs. Once a peaceful country nestled between the world’s largest cocaine producers, Colombia and Peru,Ecuador has become a new front line in a conflictbetween powerful gangs linked to Colombian and Mexican cartels. Amid the gang-related violence, more than 430 inmate deaths have been recorded in Ecuador since 2021 in massacres that leave a trail of burned and dismembered bodies.  In late August, dozens of guards were taken hostage at several prisons around the country before eventually being released. On Ecuador’s streets, murders have quadrupled between 2018 and 2022, climbing to a record 26 per 100,000 inhabitants. That rate could climb as high as 40 per 100,000 this year, according to experts."
Record-break­er US gym­nast Si­mone Biles claims 21st world ti­tle,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/7/record-breaker-us-gymnast-simone-biles-claims-21st-world-title,US gym­nast is now the world’s most dec­o­rat­ed gym­nast ever with 34 medals across world cham­pi­onships and Olympics.,"Gymnastics superstar Simone Bilescontinued her spectacular return from a two-year break by claiming her 21st world title with all-around gold at the world gymnastics championships in Antwerp, Belgium. The United States gymnast produced a dominant display on Friday to score 58.399 points and secure the title ahead of defending champion Rebeca Andrade of Brazil (56.766), with US teammate Shilese Jones taking bronze (56.332). Biles obtained the best score on three of the four apparatuses, with the uneven bars the exception. Biles, who won her first all-around world title as a 16-year-old in Antwerp a decade ago, has now claimed a total of 27 world medals – including 21 golds – andled the US women’s team to their seventh consecutive team titleon Wednesday. In total, Biles now has 34 medals across the world championships and Olympics, making her the most decorated gymnast ever – male or female – at the sport’s two signature events. Biles has also surpassed Belarusian Vitaly Scherbo’s record of 33 medals in total at the Olympics and world championships. “Actually, I had something in my eye today that I couldn’t get out, I swear it’s true,” she told reporters. “But I was emotional because 10 years ago I won my first worlds and now we’re back here,” said Biles of her return to Antwerp, Belgium, where she opened her world tally in 2013, winning four medals, including two golds. “It means everything to me, after everything I’ve put in to get back to this place to feel comfortable and confident enough to compete.” With two more days of competition, everything suggests Biles’s medal collection will be further enriched since she still has four apparatus finals ahead. Biles has made a breathtaking comebackto the sport since the Tokyo Olympics. Arriving in Japan as the big favourite thanks to her four gold medals won five years earlier in Rio de Janeiro,Biles broke down and withdrew from four of the five finalsafter suffering from what in the sport is known as “twisties” – a temporary mental block whereby gymnasts lose their sense of where they are in the air.  Now back at the highest level, the Texan is gearing up for the Paris Olympics after taking advantage of her break to take care of her mental health. “I was actually less nervous today,” Biles said. “I was so much more nervous for team finals just because that’s when everything occurred [in Tokyo], so I was a bit traumatised from that, so today I felt a little bit more relaxed. I’m happy that’s over,” she said. Biles’s competition continues this weekend with the women’s vault and uneven bars finals on Saturday and the balance beam and floor exercise finals on Sunday. "
US ‘dis­turbed’ by Rus­sia’s plan to re­verse nu­clear test ban rat­i­fi­ca­tion,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/7/us-disturbed-by-russias-plan-to-reverse-nuclear-test-ban-ratification,Rus­sia says with­draw­al from rat­i­fi­ca­tion of nu­clear weapons test ban treaty places Moscow on ‘equal foot­ing’ with US.,"The United States said it was “disturbed” by a Russian envoy’s announcement that Moscow will reverse its ratification of a 1996 treaty that banned thetesting of nuclear weapons. Russia’s envoy to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), Mikhail Ulyanov, said on Friday that Moscow will revoke its ratification of the pact. The announcement by Ulyanov added new fuel to tensions betweenthe world’s largest nuclear weapons powersamid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and US military support for Kyiv. Ulyanov said on social media that “Russia plans to revoke ratification [which took place in the year 2000] of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty [CTBT]”. “The aim is to be on equal footing with the US who signed the treaty, but didn’t ratify it. Revocation doesn’t mean the intention to resume nuclear tests,” he said.   Though Washington signed but has not ratified the CTBT, it has observeda moratorium on nuclear weapons test explosionssince 1992. Responding to Russia’s announcement, the US State Department said it was “disturbed” by the move. “We are disturbed by the comments of Ambassador Ulyanov in Vienna today,” a US State Department spokesperson said in a statement. “A move like this by any state party needlessly endangers the global norm against nuclear explosive testing,” the State Department said. Russia should not be “wielding arms control and irresponsible nuclear rhetoric in a failing attempt to coerce other states”, the State Department added, appearing to suggest that Moscow’s plan to withdraw from the ratification of the treaty was aimed at pressuring the US and other countries who are supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russian forces.  Ulyanov’s statement followeda day after Russian President Vladimir Putinsaid that Moscow could reassess its ratification of the treaty. Speaking on Thursday at a forum with foreign affairs experts, Putin noted that the US had signed but not ratified the 1996 nuclear test ban treaty, while Russia had signed and also ratified. Russia might adjust its stance to mirror that of the US, Putin said. “Theoretically, we may revoke the ratification,” he said. “It’s up to the state duma members.” Putin also said that while some have discussed the need for Russia to conduct nuclear tests, he had not yet formed an opinion on the subject. “I’m not ready to say yet whether it’s necessary for us to conduct tests or not,” he said.  Asked if Russia’s rescinding of the ban would pave the way for the resumption of nuclear bomb tests, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that “it doesn’t mean a statement about the intention to resume nuclear tests”. Revoking Russia’s ratification of the ban would “bring the situation to a common denominator” with the US, Peskov said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged “all nuclear weapon states to publicly reaffirm their moratoriums against nuclear testing and their commitment to the CTBT”, UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said on Friday. Robert Floyd, the executive director of the CTBTO, which monitors compliance with the pact,said in a statementthat it would “be concerning and deeply unfortunate if any State Signatory were to reconsider its ratification of the CTBT”.  “The Russian Federation has consistently reaffirmed its strong support of the CTBT since its very inception, helping to negotiate the Treaty in the Conference on Disarmament, signing the day it opened for signature on 24 September 1996, and ratifying it in June 2000,” Floyd said. “The CTBT has established a powerful norm against nuclear testing and is making an invaluable contribution to international peace and security, for the good of humanity. It is more important than ever that we reinforce that contribution,” he added."

"Her son was killed by the Colom­bian mil­i­tary. Now, she’s get­ting an apol­o­gy",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/her-son-was-killed-by-the-colombian-military-now-shes-getting-an-apology,De­fence Min­is­ter Ivan Ve­lasquez has apol­o­gised to fam­i­lies of 19 civil­ians killed by sol­diers un­der false pre­tens­es.,"Bogota, Colombia –Nearly two decades after the Colombian army killed her 19-year-old son, Beatriz Mendez heard the words she had long waited for. On Tuesday, Defence MinisterIvan Velasquezissued a public apology for theextrajudicial killingsof 19 civilians, including Mendez’s son and nephew, clearing their names of any wrongdoing and acknowledging the state’s responsibility for their deaths. “We come to ask for forgiveness,” said Velasquez. “We know that today it is difficult to obtain forgiveness because the state has tried to hide the truth.” PresidentGustavo Petroand army head Luis Ospina Gutierrez also issued apologies. It was the first time the state admitted its role in the scandal, known as the case of the “false positives”. The term describes a practicein the militaryof murdering civilians and passing them off as rebels in Colombia’sdecades-long internal conflict, in order to boost the number of combat “kills” that soldiers could claim credit for. Those statistics, in turn, allowed the military to claim the tide was turning in its war against theRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia(FARC), the largest rebel group at the time. Mendez’s son, Weimar Castro Mendez, and her nephew, Edwar Rincon Mendez, were last seen on June 21, 2004. They disappeared from the impoverished neighbourhood where they lived in southern Bogota, while out on a walk with a friend. Two days later, the Mendez family learned from a radio broadcast that the army had identified the two young men as rebel fighters killed in combat. Mendez, who had been in a nearby rural town at the time of the disappearances, arrived in Bogota to find her son and nephew in a coffin. Their bodies, dressed in blood-stained rebel fatigues, were riddled with dozens of bullets. The corneas of her son’s eyes had been removed. “It was terrible, like something out of a horror movie,” said Mendez. Their gruesome deaths marked only the beginning of Mendez’s trials. After she reported the crime and sent letters pleading for justice to then-PresidentAlvaro Uribeand his defence ministry, anonymous callers flooded her phone with death threats, forcing her into hiding for five years. Experts estimate the 19 killings acknowledged this week are only the tip of the iceberg, a tiny fraction of the deaths the government is responsible for. Between 2002 and 2008 alone, at least 6,402 civilians were killed extrajudicially, according to theSpecial Peace Jurisdiction (JEP), a tribunal created out of the2016 peace dealbetween the FARC and the government. Many of the victims were poor farmers from the countryside or young men from cities who were lured to remote areas with job offers. The JEP has placed more than 3,500 military members under investigation for crimes related to the killings, but human rights advocates believe the deaths represent a broader, institutional failing. “The state has a duty to guarantee human rights. If these rights are violated, even if there is no direct responsibility, there is a responsibility for having failed to prevent the events and for failing to protect the rights of citizens,” said Maria Camila Moreno, director of the International Court of Transitional Justice (ICTJ), a nonprofit dedicated to pursuing accountability for mass human rights abuses. That belief, however, has stirred controversy in Colombia, where right-wing politicians have pushed back on the notion that the crimes were systematic and ordered by army superiors. Colombian courts have ordered previous administrations to issue formal apologies as part of reparations owed to victims. But former PresidentIvan Duquerefused to comply, said Pilar Castillo, director of Asociación Minga, a group that offers legal representation to victims of extrajudicial killings. Duque’s inaction reflects a wider culture of denial, Castillo added. “In effect, the Duque administration did not have the political will to comply with the rulings because it would have meant acknowledging that the extrajudicial killings were a criminal practice within the military forces,” she said. She pointed out that the Duque government was not alone in dodging responsibility: The administrations of President Uribe and his successorJuan Manuel Santoslikewise denied extrajudicial killings were a systemic problem in the military. Instead, the administrations argued that the cases were isolated, a narrative that has been refuted by the JEP but continues to circulate in right-wing sectors, according to Moreno, the ICTJ director. In JEP hearings, however, military officials have testified that state policies and pressure from superiors motivated the crimes. Extrajudicial killings increased in 2005 when the Defence Ministry announced a directive that rewarded military members with vacations, promotions and bonuses for combat kills. Officials have also told the JEP that former Colombian military GeneralMario Montoyaordered soldiers to prioritise kills over captures. The JEP has so far indicted three generals, including Montoya, who is charged with the extrajudicial killings of 130 civilians during his time as Fourth Brigade commander, from 2002 to 2003. In September, retired General Henry Torres Escalante publicly confessed to ordering extrajudicial killings and hampering investigations into the crimes. At the public event on Tuesday, relatives of the 19 victims gave emotional testimonies on stage in front of top military brass. Some refused to accept the state’s apology, and others cursed at the country’s armed forces. A few called on former presidents Uribe and Santos — who served as his predecessor’s defence minister — to publicly apologise as well. Santos, who received theNobel Peace Prizefor ushering in a peace deal with the FARC during his presidency, apologised to victims in 2021, but his statement was issued in a closed-door hearing. He told local media he had not been invited to Tuesday’s public event. On Wednesday, Uribe denied that his administration was responsible for the crimes, without mentioning the possibility of a public apology. Castillo, the director of Asociación Minga, said that Tuesday’s formal apology had been a priority for victims’ families because top government officials, including Uribe and Santos, had either denied the killings or justified the military’s actions when the scandal first broke in 2008. Some of the victims, for example, have been accused of being criminals, in order to downplay their deaths, according to families and rights advocates. Mendez, who has spent almost two decades fighting to prove her son’s innocence, said her child had never been involved in criminal activities. At the time of his death, he had recently graduated from high school and aspired to find a job to help take care of his family. She considers Tuesday’s apology from Defence Minister Velasquez to be a result of her fight — and that of thousands of others. “We’ve demonstrated that everything that we’ve done for our sons wasn’t in vain,” she said."
US auto work­ers halt strike ex­pan­sion af­ter con­ces­sions on EV bat­tery plant,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/us-auto-workers-halt-strike-expansion-after-concessions-on-ev-battery-plant,"UAW Pres­i­dent Fain prais­es break­through, with im­pli­ca­tions for labour arrange­ments un­der­gird­ing green tran­si­tion.","The United Auto Workers (UAW) union has said that it will not furtherexpand its strikeafter winning a major breakthrough, bringing electric vehicle battery plants into the union’s national contract. In a video appearance on Friday, UAW PresidentShawn Fainsaid that the decision would change the future of the union and the auto industry, and that further strike expansions would be momentarily paused. “Our strike is working, but we’re not there yet,” said Fain. The agreement would virtually guarantee that workers at the EV battery plant will be broughtinto the union fold, a concession that could prompt rivals to take similar steps, with strong implications for the form of labour arrangements undergirding the US transition away from fossil fuels.  “This defines the transition to EVs,” Harley Shaiken, labour professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told the Reuters news agency. “Clearly, GM’s concession on the master agreement will positively be matched by Ford and Stellantis.” In a post on social media, David Dayen, editor of The American Prospect, an outlet that has closely followed the strike and labour developments within the industry, called the decision an “enormous win for workers in the EV transition”. The fate of the battery plants was seen as a substantial obstacle to a final agreement between the UAW and the “Detroit Three” automakers of Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis, the subjects of anationwide strikethat began in mid-September. “GM has agreed to lay the foundation for a just transition,” Fain said, adding the company had “leapfrogged” the pack in negotiations withthe UAW. Fain added that progress had been made with Stellantis but that there were “gaps that still need to be closed”. Fain said that the change in position from GM, which had previously pushed back against demands to extend agreements to EV plants, came after the union threatened to expand the strike to a plant that makes highly profitable SUVs in Arlington, Virginia.  The union leader said that the strike could still be expanded to such lucrative plants if progress in talks stalls out. “We know their pain points. We know their moneymakers and we know the plants they really don’t want struck,” Fain said. “And they know we’ve got more cards left to play.”"
Poland and Hun­gary clash with EU lead­ers over mi­gra­tion re­form,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/poland-and-hungary-clash-with-eu-leaders-over-migration-reform,Mi­gra­tion has be­come a flash­point in the Eu­ro­pean con­ti­nent’s pol­i­tics and a cen­tral fo­cus of far-right par­ties.,"The far-right leaders of Hungary and Poland have rejected a group statement on irregular migration as a summit of European leaderscame to a close. Hungarian Prime MinisterViktor Orbanand Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki shot down a proposed statement for inclusion in a document on the summit’s conclusion on Friday. The move forced European Council President Charles Michel to issue a separate statement in his name about asylum policy and border protection, and the French and German leaders said the legislative process on the issue would continue as planned. Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who hosted the summit in Granada, dismissed concerns about the clash. “The most important thing is what our interior ministers achieved a few weeks ago with the agreement on crisis regulation, because that is what is really relevant in political terms,” he said. But the gathering did hand Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who is facing a general election this weekend, and Hungary’s Viktor Orban a stage on which to brandish populist credentials for their domestic audiences. Morawiecki boasted that his “veto” on a joint statement on migration “meant that this process will not proceed … and Poland has a chance to stop it.” Orban compared accepting refugees to sexual assault. “The agreement on migration, politically, it’s impossible — not today [or] generally speaking for the next years,” Orban said. “Because legally we are, how to say it – we are raped. So if you are raped legally, forced to accept something what you don’t like, how would you like to have a compromise?”  The bloc of European nations has remained divided over how to address irregular migration, a topic that has become a flashpoint in the continent’s politics and a central focus of far-right parties who have called for heightened restrictions. On Wednesday, adeal was struckon means of addressing periods of especially high arrivals, removing a key obstacle in the effort to enshrine a larger immigration overhaul before upcoming EU elections. For years, Europe has been on the forefront of a global trend of border militarisation, deportations, and deterrence measures meant to increase the risks of irregular migration. Tens of thousands of migrants and refugees, many of them fleeing war and conflict in countries like Syria and Afghanistan, have paid with their lives, drowning in desperate efforts tocross the Mediterraneanin search of safety and a better future. Human rights groups have laid such tragedies squarely at the feet of the EU’s harsh deterrent measures, which include agreements withforeign governmentsthat critics say outsource the most sordid elements of immigration enforcement and encourage rights abuses. Such steps have not stopped right-wing parties in countries like Hungary and Poland from capitalising on anxieties about migration andleaning into rhetoricthat describes migrants as criminals and “invaders”.  Leaders from both of those countries have flatly rejected statements that all European countries should share the distribution of newly arrived migrants. PolishPrime Minister Morawieckisaid on Friday that he would push back against a “dictate coming from Brussels and Berlin”. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen struck an optimistic note at the end of the summit, saying that Wednesday’s agreement had been “a big success”. “This was an important piece of the puzzle of the whole puzzle of the Migration and Asylum pact,” she said."
UK’s op­po­si­tion Labour Par­ty gets a boost from Scot­land by-elec­tion vic­to­ry,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/uks-opposition-labour-party-gets-a-boost-from-scotland-by-election-victory,Labour leader Keir Starmer hails ‘seis­mic re­sult’ as his par­ty takes a par­lia­men­tary seat from the SNP.,"The United Kingdom’s main opposition Labour Party has won an emphatic victory in a by-election for a Scottish district that was watched as an indicator of the party’s rebounding popularity before a national election next year. Labour took the parliamentary seat of Rutherglen and Hamilton West, near Glasgow, from the Scottish National Party. The result doubles Labour’s total of Scottish seats from one to two. Labour candidate Michael Shanks won 17,845 votes, more than twice the number taken by SNP runner-up Katy Loudon. The Scottish Conservatives came a distant third. Labour leader Keir Starmer called it a “seismic result.” “It was a big step in the right direction, an important one,” he said on Friday. The election was called when the former lawmaker, Margaret Ferrier, was removed by her constituents for breaking coronavirus restrictions in 2020 by taking a long train journey when she had COVID-19. Labour was long dominant in Scotland but in the past 15 years has been all but wiped out by the SNP, which wants Scotland to leave the UK and become an independent country. The result adds to pressure on Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf, who took over as SNP leader in March after his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon resigned amid a continuing police investigation into the party’s finances. The party, which has dominated Scottish politics for more than a decade, has seen its popularity slump and has reached an impasse in its push for a new referendum on independence. “It’s a tough day for the SNP, a disappointing result. There’s no point pretending otherwise.” Yousaf said. “The SNP has to reflect, we’ve got to regroup, we’ve got to reorganise.” Starmer’s party needs to regain ground in Scotland to win a majority of seats in a general election that must be called by the end of 2024. Labour has been out of power since 2010. University of Strathclyde polling expert John Curtice said the 20 percent swing to Labour – if replicated at a general election – could allow the party to recapture dozens of seats north of the border. That could have “implications for the overall outcome in the general election because, if that were to happen, they would find it easier to get an overall majority”, Curtice added. Starmer’s Labour has enjoyed double-digit poll leads for months as Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s government has grappled with stubbornly high inflation and a cost-of-living crisis. Recent surveys, however, have shown the gap narrowing, following a host of populist policies announced by Sunak in recent weeks. But Curtice said the Scottish result “firmly” confirmed “the direction of travel indicated by the polls”. The Conservative Party also suffered a big defeat to Labour in July in the northern English constituency of Selby and Ainsty. Curtice said taken together the wins were the “kind of results that you see in advance of general elections when parties are on course to win”, adding that it had been a “remarkably good night” for Labour. Labour was once the dominant force in Scottish politics but has seen its influence decline at a national level since the end of Prime Minister Gordon Brown’s government in 2010. In the devolved Scottish parliament in Edinburgh, the SNP has long been the biggest party and currently governs in a coalition with the pro-independence Greens."
Iowa risks mil­lions of dol­lars as it faces los­ing first-vote sta­tus,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/10/6/iowa-risks-millions-of-dollars-as-it-faces-losing-first-vote-status,De­moc­rats mov­ing from Iowa to South Car­oli­na for first vote in pri­ma­ry cy­cle means less mon­ey for Mid­west­ern state.,"Des Moines, Iowa, United States –When Michael LaValle talks about the Iowa caucuses, he remembers the glory days. He recalls when the likes of Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw, major TV news anchors, would descend on the state, ready for wall-to-wall coverage of the caucuses, the first big event in the United States presidential primary calendar. His children got to meet legendary news host Dan Rather. The 70-year-old event space manager has seen lots of change in the seven election cycles he has lived here – and from his perspective, it has not all been for the better. More recently, there have been fewer visitors. And because of the nature of digital news, journalists and the campaigns sweep through in a couple of days rather than occupying hotel rooms for months on end. But now that change is going to get a lot worse. This year, Democrats voted to shift their primary calendar, naming South Carolina — and not Iowa — as their first official party contest in all future presidential races. LaValle is one of Iowa’s business owners decrying the decision because it will cost him. In previous presidential election years, Des Moines, the state capital, had seen its coffers boosted by as much as $11m in just the one week leading up to the caucuses. The loss will not be felt much in the 2024 cycle. Republicans are still holding their first vote in Iowa in January, and Democrats are not holding a full-on primary contest, given that President Joe Biden faces few serious challengers from within his own party as he seeks re-election. But LaValle doubts the state will see the hustle and bustle of election years such as 2016 and 2008 when neither party had an incumbent running and both spent heavily in the state. After all, winning in Iowa at the time could set the tone for the rest of the primary season, signalling whether a candidate had popular appeal — or not. LaValle has had a good perch from which to watch the change. Not only did he hold events for the likes of Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders, his uncle was pivotal in launching the caucus process back in the 1970s. “My uncle Cliff Larson was the state Democratic chair who started the caucuses,” LaValle tells Al Jazeera. The 1968 party convention in Chicago – coming just months after the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr and Robert F Kennedy – saw Hubert Humphrey and Edmund Muskie chosen for the presidential ticket. But it also saw widespread protests and a harsh crackdown by Chicago police. After this chaos, the party decided it had to find a better way to select a candidate, and Iowa was chosen to start the revised process. Soon, the largely agricultural state would become known as a kingmaker, credited in 1976 with helping a dark-horse candidate take the White House: politician and peanut farmer Jimmy Carter. Other candidates likewise found their prospects bolstered by the Iowa caucuses. George W Bush, for example, won the caucuses and then the presidency in 2000. And in 2008, Democratic up-and-comer Obama came out ahead of Hillary Clinton in the party vote, a bellwether for who would prevail in the nomination contest overall. Of course, candidates can lose in Iowa and still secure the nomination — Joe Biden proved that in 2020 — but those exceptions can be counted with a single hand. The decision by Democrats to opt for South Carolina follows mounting pressure from activists to select a state more demographically representative of the nation and the party’s most loyal supporters, particularly African Americans. Iowa is 90 percent white compared with the national average of 71 percent. South Carolina was also the stage for Biden’s dramatic comeback in the 2020 race, and Iowa did nothing to help itself by going through a technological meltdown on caucus night. In a caucus people actually have to vote in person. In Iowa that means invariably on a freezing night in the middle of winter in gyms, church halls, community centres and sometimes people’s homes. They last for an hour or two, with people debating and making a case for the candidate of their choice. Traditionally, totals were tallied by hand and the information forward to the party’s state headquarters. In 2020 Democrats used an app to help the vote count which didn’t record all the votes, leading to a manual count and massive delays. For now there’s still a lobby in Iowa, including business leaders and Democratic politicians, saying the party should rethink its decision to relocate. Greg Edwards is CEO of Catch Des Moines, the city’s convention and tourism body. He says it is impossible to calculate precisely the amount the caucuses generate. “Nobody knows,” he says. “It’s obviously millions of dollars, and it’s over $11m that we can quantify here, just for the week leading up to the caucus with all the candidates and the media and all the hoopla and all of that, which we absolutely love.” The businesses most obviously vulnerable are hotels restaurants and retail outlets. Edwards says he hopes Democrats and others will lobby for Iowa to be returned to its first place on the starting grid. One argument that Iowa’s champions make is that the state acts as a “screening process” for the candidates. When candidates come to Iowa, they often attend smaller, more intimate events than they would in more populous states. They could be asked about anything from farm policies to the war in Ukraine. South Carolina may also in time turn into such a process, but it is starting from scratch, having not played that role before. Which state holds the first primary or caucus vote is important because if candidates do well there, it can give them a springboard onto New Hampshire and the other early voting states before Super Tuesday, the day when the greatest number of states hold primary elections and caucuses – with as many as a third of delegates up for grabs. Critics of Iowa say because it is overwhelmingly white and heavily religious, it often benefits candidates pitching conservative ideas who are out of touch with the rest of the nation. Questions about the caucuses’ future come as Iowa Democrats battle to rebound from nothing short of a crisis. For the first time in 50 years, the state’s congressional delegation to Washington, DC, has been entirely made up of Republicans. Popular Republican Kim Reynolds was last year re-elected to a second term as governor, and the GOP, or Grand Old Party, controls both houses of the state legislature. The state Democratic Party did not respond to multiple inquiries about the caucuses and its challenges. While Democrats have been reduced to just one statewide elected official – state auditor Rob Sand – the party recently enjoyed a surprise success in Warren County, 32km (20 miles) south of Des Moines, which Donald Trump won easily in 2020. Democrat Kimberly Sheets beat Republican David Whipple to become county auditor, bagging 67 percent of votes after Whipple denied the 2020 election results. Sheets says her victory was the result of hard work and the backing of a number of Republicans. She believes Iowa is an ideal place to hold the initial presidential vote and says the impact of losing its first-vote status will be considerable. “Because you get all your candidates to come, your followers, your news reporters,” she says. “It’s very exciting to see Iowa in the front of the papers. A lot of people think of Iowa and they think of corn and farmers.” “Yes, that’s a big part of our culture,” she adds. “But we’re also big insurance companies. We’re CEOs. We’re philanthropists. There’s a lot that happens in Iowa that people aren’t aware of.” Paul Rottenberg, a Des Moines businessman whose interests include the restaurant Zombie Burger, says the shifting of the caucuses will have an impact on hotels and restaurants. “For any individual, there’s going to be some impact. Whether that’s a damaging impact or not, I think is questionable, and I don’t think it is,” he says. He pointed out that the advent of digital news has changed the way the media covers the event: There are fewer journalists, and they stay for shorter periods of time. There are still good nights to be had, but they are unlikely to change the bottom line in a make-or-break way, he says. “I’ve always felt like if your restaurant needed a big New Year’s Eve to succeed, you’re probably in the wrong business.” Apparel company Raygun, which specialises in humorous designs, many of them with a liberal message, hopes to challenge how outsiders view the state. “We really thrived off the interactions with the Democratic Party,” spokesperson Kat Correa explains. “Most candidates would even come by our location.” While the company has managed to bounce back from the general downturn of Democratic interest in Iowa by diversifying its product line, it says overall traffic levels have “significantly decreased”. Correa adds, “The Iowa caucus provided an opportunity for us to make our quick-witted T-shirt jokes. Now all the spotlight will be on South Carolina, and we don’t know how the products will be received.”"

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 336,000 jobs last month, the Department of Labor said, while data for August was revised higher to show 227,000 jobs were added instead of the previously reported 187,000. September’s number was almost double the 170,000 forecast of economists polled by Reuters and shocked markets as they tried to understand whether a stronger-than-expected economy was really slowing and what it will now take tocurb inflation. “The markets have been reacting to their view that the Fed is as confused as we are,” said Marvin Loh, senior global macro strategist at State Street in Boston. “Maybe the economy has structurally changed to the point where real yields need to be higher than what they were in the five years before the pandemic,” he said.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note jumped more than 13 basis points within a half hour after the report’s release to a new 16-year high of 4.8874 percent, adding to this month’s steep sell-off. Bond yields move inversely to price. Futures traders raised the probability of the Fedhiking ratesin November to 30.7 percent, up from 23.7 percent before the data’s release, according to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool. The Fed’s overnight rate was priced above 5 percent through next July. “We’ll see how much tightening the market does for the Fed, but a run at the 5 percent mark in 10-year yields may be inevitable if the data continues to hold up like this,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of US rates strategy at TD Securities USA in New York. The dollar index was up 0.29 percent as it headed towards a 12-week winning streak after hitting its best level in about 11 months earlier in the week. The yen slid closer to 150 yen to the dollar, a level many in the market believe can spur intervention by Japanese officials. The euro headed for a record 12 straight weeks of declines against the dollar. Simon Harvey, head of FX Analysis at Monex Europe, said the “monstrous payrolls” figures and upwards revision to the August numbers will support the dollar’s advance. “Given the strength in today’s employment figures, markets can’t fully discount the probability of a Fed hike in the fourth quarter, even as it coincided with weaker wage data.” Stocks fell on Wall Street, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors initially lower, but later pared losses with the Nasdaq moving higher. The data led stocks to pare gains in European markets. After talk of oil hitting $100 a barrel, crude slid further and faced its steepest weekly decline since March. Traders are worried that higher for longer rates would crimp global economic growth and hit fuel demand. News that Russia’s government was lifting a ban on pipeline diesel exports via ports also dampened oil prices. Eurozone bond yields gained, while the closely-watched gap between German and Italian borrowing costs – an indicator of stress in Italian finances – hit its highest since March.

Pales­tin­ian killed in Is­raeli set­tler at­tack on West Bank town,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/palestinian-killed-as-israeli-settlers-attack-west-bank-town-of-huwara,The killing of 19-year-old Labib Du­mai­di comes amid a pe­ri­od of ris­ing set­tler vi­o­lence across the West Bank.,"A Palestinian has been killed when a group of Israeli settlers attacked the town of Huwara, amid a surge insettler violenceacross the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Labib Dumaidi, 19, was shot in the heart by an Israeli settler, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said on Friday. Relatives said he had sought refuge on the roof of his home, which was under assault from settlers, when a settler shot him. The Israeli military has offered a different account, stating that a suspect was shot after throwing a brick at a vehicle, but offering no details on the victim’s identity. “More than 200 settlers gathered in the middle of Huwara after midnight, shouting and dancing, some of them with covered faces,” Palestinian resident Abderrahman Dmidi told the news agency AFP.  “They began throwing stones towards some houses, and then the young people … tried to defend their homes by throwing stones,” he added. Residents said Israeli soldiers turned a blind eye to the violence. “It’s clear that the settler militias are protected by the occupation’s soldiers,” Thaer Qawareeq, an employee at a supermarket damaged by the settlers in Huwara, told the Reuters news agency. He added that it was the third time that settlers had assaulted the store. The killing of Dumaidi, a university student, has come amid a rise in settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, including instances of mob violence targeting Palestinian towns and residents, often in the presence ofIsraeli soldiers. Some of the assaults have followed attacks by Palestinians on Israeli settlements and settlers. The attack on Friday came a day after a Palestinian gunman shot at an Israeli car in Huwara. The town is located on a road between the Palestinian cities of Nablus and Ramallah and is surrounded by Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the killing of Dumaidi a “heinous crime”. The Palestinian Red Crescent reported that at least 51 Palestinians were injured during a funeral procession for Dumaidi, as Israeli forces fired tear gas,rubber-tipped bullets, and live fire. Settler violence against Palestinians has seen asubstantial uptickover the last year, occurring at a rate of three per day for the first eight months of 2023, according to the United Nations. While Palestinian attacks on residents of Jewish settlements often meet harsh countermeasures, accountability from Israeli authorities in cases of settler violence has been rare. Palestinians have said that the impunity is part of a deliberate campaign to push themoff their land.  Huwara itself has been the scene of some of the most notable recent cases of settler violence: following the slaying of two Israeli brothers by a Palestinian in February, a mob of right-wing settlers rampagedthrough the town, firing weapons and killing a 37-year-old man. Israel’s far-right Minister of FinanceBezalel Smotricharoused controversy when he commented that Huwara should be “wiped out” several days after. "
Pak­istan sur­vive Nether­lands scare in first ICC Crick­et World Cup 2023 win,https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2023/10/6/pakistan-beat-netherlands-by-runs-in-icc-cricket-world-cup-2023,Haris Rauf took three wick­ets as Pak­istan’s bowlers dis­missed Nether­lands for 205.,"Pakistan have opened theirICC Cricket World Cup 2023campaign with an 81-run win over the Netherlands but not before a determined Dutch side gave Babar Azam’s team a scare at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium in Hyderabad. Fast bowler Haris Rauf took three wickets to wrap up the Dutch innings in 41 overs in the south Indian city on Friday. All-rounder Bas de Leede shone for the Netherlands as he top-scored for his side with 67 runs after taking four wickets earlier on. Dutch opener Vikramjit Singh scored 52 runs and was involved in a 70-run partnership with de Leede that threatened to hand Pakistan a shock loss in their first game. Pakistan’s fast bowlers, including Rauf, Hasan Ali and Shaheen Shah Afridi took six wickets between them to give their side a winning start to the tournament. Spinners Shadab Khan, Iftikhar Ahmed and Mohammad Nawaz took one apiece. Earlier, Pakistan were bowled out for 286 in an innings that featured half-centuries from Saud Shakeel and Mohammad Rizwan. De Leede finished with 4-62 to bring the Netherlands back into the game after Shakeel struck an attractive 52-ball 68 and Rizwan’s 75-ball 68 had boosted Pakistan after they were sent in to bat. The Netherlands justified the decision to bowl first as pacer Logan van Beek had out-of-form opener Fakhar Zaman caught and bowled for 12 in the fourth over. Spinner Colin Ackermann then claimed the prized wicket of Pakistan skipper Babar Azam for five before Paul van Meekeren dismissed Imam-ul-Haq for 15 to leave Pakistan tottering at 38-3. Shakeel and Rizwan – playing their first World Cup match – steadied the innings with a solid 120-run stand for the fourth wicket but three wickets fell in the space of 24 balls for 30 runs. Pakistan were further lifted as Mohammad Nawaz (39) and Shadab Khan (32) added 64 for the seventh wicket but de Leede dismissed Shadab and Hasan Ali off successive deliveries. Nawaz was run out in the 47th over before Haris Rauf’s dismissal off Ackermann finished the innings in 49 overs."
‘They mis­cal­cu­lat­ed’: Ukraine turns the ta­bles on Rus­sia’s Black Sea Fleet,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/they-miscalculated-ukraine-turns-the-tables-on-russias-black-sea-fleet,Rus­sia re­lo­cates ships from Sev­astopol while the UK lauds Kyiv’s ‘func­tion­al de­feat of the Black Sea Fleet’.,"Kyiv, Ukraine –“Russian warship, go f*** yourself!” is the phrase dating back to the first days of the Russia-Ukrainian war, that spawned countless memes and bumper stickers. It is what Ukrainian servicemen stationed on the ZmiinyIsland, or Snake Island, in the Black Sea replied to the Russian warship’s urge to surrender. But by early 2022, the Russian Black Sea Fleet based in annexed Crimea, seemed to have gained absolute control over Ukraine’s territorial waters in the Black Sea and its smaller, shallower sibling, the Sea of Azov. Its larger ships shelled Ukraine’s main seaport, Odesa, and other southern cities with missiles and drones, killing civilians and destroying apartment buildings, military installations and port infrastructure. Smaller Russian navy vessels stopped and officiously inspected merchant ships carrying grain and sunflower oil, Ukraine’s key exports. Russian navy felt at ease in all of the Black Sea’s northern part – but after almost 600 days of war, the tables have turned. “They miscalculated,” Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, the former deputy chief of Ukraine’s general staff of armed forces, told Al Jazeera. “We won’t let them rest and won’t rest ourselves until we fully de-occupy our lands.” Satellite imagery shows that at least a dozen Russian vessels, including guided missile frigates, landing ships and submarines, have been hastily relocated from their main base in Sevastopol, a subtropical port in annexed Crimea. Most were moved to the Russian port of Novorossiisk more than 300km (186 miles) east of Sevastopol, or on other, smaller bases or bays in eastern Crimea or along Russia’s Black Sea coast. British Defence Minister James Heappey compared the “functional defeat of the Black Sea Fleet” to the liberation of Kharkiv Oblast one year ago. “The fleet has been forced to disperse to ports from which it cannot have an effect on Ukraine,” he said on Tuesday. The relocation follows a series of daring Ukrainian attacks with Western-supplied cruise missiles and domestically assembled aerial and naval drones that destroyed flagships, smaller cutters and even a docked submarine. They also annihilated two advanced S-400 air defence systems creating sizeable “holes” in the sky over Crimea. And, most importantly, they damaged a major shipyard with a dry dock that was essential for repairing decades-old Russian ships. “What was critical for Russia wasn’t damage to vessels, it was damage to the shipyard,” Kyiv-based analyst Ihar Tyshkevich told Al Jazeera. “This is the reason why a large part of the Black Sea fleet vessels were relocated to Novorossiisk.” On September 22, Kyiv barraged and partially destroyed the Fleet’s headquarters in a snow-white Stalinist building in Sevastopol. The attacks dramatically reduced Russia’s capabilities to land troops near Odesa and back occupying forces in the southern region of Kherson, analysts have said. “Ukraine’s actions have wrestled control of Ukraine’s western territorial waters back from Russia and prevented the Black Sea Fleet from threatening Odesa with amphibious assault or providing tactical fires and logistical support to Russian forces in Kherson,” retired US Army Major General Gordon Skip Davis Jr told Al Jazeera. The success seems even more staggering given that Ukraine’s minuscule navy lost most of its ships during Crimea’s 2014 annexation and consists of two dozen obsolete vessels that can all fit into a tiny bay. The possibility of future sea drone attacks deterred Russian ships that inspected vessels with Ukrainian grain. Russian ships “can defend themselves with a relative effect only if there’s a group of vessels”, while inspections make logistical sense only if carried out by individual ships, analyst Tyshkevich said. However, these days, Ukrainian and international shipping companies prefer to use smaller vessels that can move along the Black Sea coast towards Romanian ports on the Danube, a gateway to Eastern and Central Europe. But “the Danube ports are not deep, a Panamax ship [with a tonnage of more than 50,000] won’t enter them, and the cargo needs to be reloaded either at sea or in other ports,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. Therefore, the overall capacity of the Odesa port fell tenfold, and only about 20 vessels carrying about 100,000 tonnes of wheat leave it every month, he said. The irony is that the entire Black Sea fleet could have been Ukrainian if it was not for the pacifism of its early leaders – and Ukraine’s dire economic situation in the 1990s. Founded in Sevastopol in 1783, the fleet won naval battles with Ottoman Turkey, fought Nazi Germans and often confronted NATO in the Mediterranean. Ukraine proclaimed independence on August 24, 1991, and just days later, Moscow appointed Admiral Igor Kasatonov as head of the gargantuan fleet that employed some 100,000 servicemen and 60,000 auxiliary staffers serving 833 warships and hundreds of aircraft. It had bases in what is now Russia, Moldova and Georgia, and Soviet naval outposts in Syria and Libya reported to it. Kasatonov arrived in Kyiv in early 1992 to meet Ukraine’s first post-Soviet President Leonid Kravchuk and pledge allegiance to Kyiv, a witness said. But the meeting did not go well, and he ran out of it “absolutely crazy”, photographer Efrem Lukatsky told Al Jazeera. “He began to spill his guts to me, and said that [Kravchuk], as it turns out, didn’t need the Fleet,” he said. The decision seemed logical at the time as Ukraine simply could not afford to maintain the fleet, and Kasatonov pledged allegiance to Russia on January 4, 1992. Moscow and Kyiv decided to run the fleet jointly as idle ships rusted away and were often sold for scrap metal. Rumours had it that even Colombian drug cartels could buy a small submarine for smuggling cocaine. Only in 1997, Moscow and Kyiv partitioned the fleet – very unevenly. Kyiv got 30 warships and cutters, one submarine, 34 auxiliary ships and 90 aircraft. Moscow got 338 warships, 106 planes and helicopters and agreed to lease several bases in and around Sevastopol and several other locations in Crimea. The lease cost Russia almost $100m annually, and the fleet remained the largest employer in Sevastopol. Since the 1944 Stalinist deportation of several Crimean communities – Tatars, Greeks, Armenians and Bulgarians – Moscow moved hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians to the peninsula. They largely remained loyal to Moscow and stubbornly resisted Kyiv’s attempts to promote Ukrainian as the language of administration and education. Politically, they were close to the Russian “red belt” regions that supported Communists. “Ukrainian Crimea mentally was a total part of it,” Sergey Biziykin, a fugitive Russian opposition activist who visited Crimea in the early 2000s, told Al Jazeera. Kremlin-controlled media widely available in Crimea transformed its residents’ pro-Communist sympathies into loyalty to Russia in general as cash-strapped Kyiv did not invest in the peninsula’s decaying infrastructure. “They ignore us, they see us as a place for cheap vacations,” Valentina Minina, a pro-Moscow protester in Sevastopol holding a Russian flag, told this reporter just days before the March 16, 2014 “referendum” that heralded Crimea’s annexation. “We want to be with Russia because it respects us, it will make things right here.”"
Friend­ly foes Afghanistan and Bangladesh ‘ready’ for World Cup meet­ing,https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2023/10/6/bangladesh-vs-afghanistan-icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-preview,Afghanistan have nev­er beat­en Bangladesh at the ICC Crick­et World Cup and will aim to change that in Sat­ur­day’s match.,"Who:Afghanistan vs Bangladesh Where:HPCA Stadium, Dharamsala, India When:Saturday, October 7, 10:30am (05:00 GMT) A month after Bangladesh beat Afghanistan in theAsia Cup, the two South Asian teams will face off for their opening match of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 at the picturesque HPCA stadium in Dharamsala. It will be Afghanistan’s third appearance atICC Cricket World Cupsince their debut in 2015 when they were dubbed the rising stars of the game. They have now built a reputation as world-beaters and boast one of the world’s biggest stars in leg-spinning all-rounder Rashid Khan. Khan will be ably supported in the spin department by former captain Mohammad Nabi and young off-spinner Mujib Ur Rahman as the team look to make it past the group stage for the first time. Afghanistan captain Hashmatullah Shahidi has said his team is “totally ready” for their third Cricket World Cup. “We have had meetings, we prepared ourselves and we know them [Bangladesh] very well, so we will play accordingly and we will try our best as a team to bounce back in this game against them.”  Meanwhile, their opponents Bangladesh will be looking to move past the pre-tournament controversies that stemmed from the squad selection and get a win on the board. The only previous occasion when captain Shakib al-Hasan’s side made it to the quarterfinals was at the 2015 edition in Australia and New Zealand. Their Sri Lankan coach Chandika Hathurusingha has said he will settle for nothing less than a semifinal finish this time as they play in close-to-home conditions in India. “Yeah, we all want to win the World Cup … if we win four-five games, we give ourselves a chance to get to the semifinal – that is our first aim,” Hathurusingha said. Bangladesh will miss the services of their leading ODI batterTamim Iqbal, who continues to grapple with back issues. However, upcoming batter Towhid Hridoy, who has been marked as one of the future, and Tanzid Hasan Tamim of Bangladesh’s Under-19 World Cup-winning team will look to make the most of the opportunity.  Bangladesh and Afghanistan played 15 ODIs, of which Bangladesh have won nine and Afghanistan six. Both of their meetings in the ICC Cricket World Cup (in 2015 and 2019) have gone Bangladesh’s way. Despite holding the upper hand against Saturday’s opponents, Bangladesh have had their fair share of losses in recent ODIs. Afghanistan have suffered a string of defeats in the recently-concluded Asia Cup despite boasting a talented line-up.

Why Ukraine wants fe­male con­scripts for war,https://www.aljazeera.com/podcasts/2023/10/6/why-ukraine-wants-women-conscripts-for-war,Ukraine’s new mil­i­tary con­scrip­tion law means that women with med­ical de­grees now have to reg­is­ter to join the fight.," A new wave of conscription is affecting Ukrainian women, going into effect for women with a medical or pharmaceutical education. When this new law was first proposed last year, it was postponed because of the public outcry. But with Ukraine’s soldiers, volunteers and conscripts alike, going through months of grueling war, there is a growing awareness in Ukraine that the country is in for the long haul. The optimism that the war could end this year is ebbing away. So, what does this law say about Ukraine’s position in the war, and is it a sign of the changing role of women in Ukrainian society?

Who is No­bel Peace Prize win­ner Narges Mo­ham­ma­di?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/who-is-nobel-peace-prize-winner-narges,The jailed No­bel lau­re­ate has been a promi­nent voice in Iran’s women’s move­ment.,"When the chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced the winner of the peace prize,Narges Mohammadi, she recited a slogan associated with the women’s rights movement in Iran. “Women, life, freedom,” Berit Reiss-Andersen said on Friday. Mohammadi is a prominent Iranian human rights activist and physicist who has been fighting against the oppression of women in Iran. Here is what we know about theNobel Peace Prize winner: Mohammadi’s focus is on the fight for women’s rights in the region. The 51-year-old is also a writer and deputy director of the Defenders of Human Rights Center (DHRC). She also works on broader human rights issues, such as campaigning against the death penalty and corruption. “She has worked for human rights for everyone in Iran, so this is going to be a huge boost to the human rights defenders centre and one that is putting her work in Iran on the map,” Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute, told Al Jazeera. Mohammadi wonthe prize“for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all”, according to the Norwegian Nobel Committee. She has worked on Iranian women’s fight against oppression for the past 30 years. She has contributed to the grassroots movement in Iran by empowering women through education and advocacy. Her work has included organising protests and sit-ins and writing essays. Mohammadi is currently serving a 12-year sentence in Evin Prison in Tehran for charges that include spreading propaganda against the state. This is not Mohammadi’s first sentence. She was first arrested in 2011 and held in Evin. She was againarrested in 2015, days after she was charged in court with crimes against national security, propaganda against the state and forming an illegal group called Step by Step to Stop the Death Penalty, Mohammadi told the US-based International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. She was held in Zanjan Central Prison andreleased in 2020after her sentence was reduced. “The regime has arrested her 13 times, convicted her five times and sentenced her to a total of 31 years in prison and 154 lashes,” Reiss-Andersen said at the announcement ceremony in Oslo, Norway. In September 2022,Mahsa Amini, 22, was arrested in Tehran by the morality police for alleged non-compliance with Iran’s dress code. She was taken to a re-education centre where she collapsed. She was then taken to a hospital where she died a few days later. Mohammadi said the day of Amini’s death has become a day that symbolises “the oppression of the theocratic authoritarian regime against Iranian women” in a message sent from prison, according toRadio Free Europe Radio Liberty. After protests against Amini’s death broke out in Iran, Mohammadi has continued to report her experience of abuse as a woman in Evin Prison. “What the government may not understand is that the more of us they lock up, the stronger we become,” she wrote for The New York Times.  Mohammadi is the second Iranian woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize after Shirin Ebadi won the award in 2003 for her efforts to promote democracy and human rights. Ebadi is an Iranian human rights activist and lawyer. In 1975, she was the first female judge to be appointed in the Iranian judiciary. She is also the first Muslim woman to win the Nobel prize. She has campaigned for the reform of Iran’s family law, including matters of divorce, inheritance and child protection. Mohammadi has worked closely with Ebadi and is the deputy director of DHRC, which was founded by Ebadi. Mohammadi’s work has come at the cost of her health. She reportedly suffers from a lung condition and a neurological disorder that causes muscular paralysis. She has not been able to meet her husband and two children due to her imprisonment. “This Nobel Prize will embolden Narges’s fight for human rights, but more importantly, this is in fact a prize for the women, life and freedom [movement],” said Mohammadi’s husband and activist Taghi Ramahi."
Why is the Biden ad­min­is­tra­tion for­giv­ing stu­dent debt?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/why-is-the-biden-administration-forgiving-student-debt,This week Joe Biden an­nounced debt re­lief worth bil­lions of dol­lars for strug­gling grad­u­ates.,"US President Joe Biden has announced a new round of federal student loan forgiveness to address the “unsustainable debt” that borrowers accumulate to complete their college education. This move aims to help 125,000 borrowers by clearing $9bn in debt through existing programmes. Since Biden took office in 2021, a total of 3.6 million borrowers will have had $127bn in debt wiped out. “We’re not done yet,” Biden said in the Roosevelt Room at the White House on Wednesday. Here’s what you need to know about the loan forgiveness: Student loan repayments restarted this month after being frozen since the COVID pandemic, and the Biden administration has adjusted earlier proposals that were rejected, to help relieve student debt. Biden has talked about pushing through reforms to education since he took office in 2021. He has said he would like make it easier for Americans to get a degree by making undergraduate programmes free, but will first tackle the debt graduates are already facing. Collectively, they owe $1.76 trillion. Earlier in the year, the US government tried to cancel amounts of up to $20,000 for 40 million borrowers, but his move wasrejected by the Supreme Court, which argued that Biden lacked the authority to push through such measures without approval from Congress. The court’s Chief Justice John Roberts stated: “The question here is not whether something should be done; it is who has the authority to do it.” Yes, for some. Teachers and social workers will be among the 53,000 borrowers who qualify for complete debt relief as will others enrolled in Public Service Loan Forgiveness programmes. In total, they will get $5.2bn in debt forgiveness, according to the Education Department. People in income-dependent relief schemes, including an estimated 51,000 borrowers owing, in total, up to $2.8bn and those who are disabled borrowers with a permanent disability, making up 22,000 people owing $1.2bn. The Biden administration plan is also offering lower monthly debt repayments for those on lower incomes. Biden announced, “No one with an undergraduate loan today or in the future, whether a community college or a four-year college, will have to pay more than 5 percent of their discretionary income to repay these loans.” In 1980, it cost $10,231 a year on average for an undergraduate programme, but by 2020, it cost $28,775. Government financial grants for those most in need, known as Pell grants, have not risen to meet the increase in fees. This has led to more people taking out student loans to cover costs.  The civil rights group, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) wants Biden to extend debt relief to Parent PLUS loans. These are loans taken by parents to help pay for their children’s higher education. Researchers foundthat 40 percent of Black graduates have student loan debt from graduate school while only 22 percent of White college graduates are in debt. In a statement, the NAACP’s president, Derrick Johnson, said, “Historically, education has been viewed as an entry point for marginalised communities to achieve upward mobility and begin building generational wealth. “It is unconscionable that, in their quest to provide their children with a brighter future, Black parents have fallen victim to a system that preys on their inherent disadvantage.” Biden has repeatedly added new programmes to the growing list of initiatives to lower or cancel student loan debt over the last two years. “My administration is doing everything we can to deliver student debt relief to as many as we can, as fast as we can,” Biden said. In June this year, the Biden administration launched the Saving on A Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan. It’s an income-based repayment scheme, where borrowers earning less than $15 an hour will not have to make payments on their loans, with a chance their loans are erased. For those earning more than $15 an hour, they will have to make monthly payments based on what they earn each month. “This kind of relief is life-changing for individuals and their families, but it’s good for our economy, as well. By freeing millions of Americans from the crushing burden of student debt, it means they can go and get their lives in order,” Biden said. “They can think about buying a house, they can start a business, they can be starting a family. This matters, it matters to their daily lives,” he added. Biden campaigned to make community college free, but failed to win support from Congress. Those opposed to the schemes have said this is Biden’s way of doing something similar without the need for Congressional approval. In February this year, former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos joined others in calling Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan illegal. “Though concerns about the rising costs of higher education and the amount of outstanding student loan debt have been part of the public discourse for decades (and long before COVID-19), the idea that the Executive Branch could unilaterally cancel student loan debt on a mass basis without Congressional authority was not seriously entertained,” DeVos said. Others have argued that the relief unfairly passes a heavy cost onto taxpayers who already repaid their own student loans or did not seek further education."
‘You can still smell the blood’: Shock turns to grief in Ukrain­ian vil­lage,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/you-can-still-smell-the-blood-shock-turns-to-grief-in-ukraines-hroza,Rel­a­tives strug­gling to cope af­ter at­tack that killed more than 50 peo­ple in tiny vil­lage in north­east­ern Ukraine.,"The missile attack was sudden and devastating. In an instant, more than 50 people – or one-sixth of the population of Hroza, a remote village in Ukraine’s northeast – werewiped out. Among those killed on Thursday in one of thedeadliest attackssince Russia invaded Ukraine some 20 months ago was Olya, 36, who is survived by three children. Her husband died, too. “It would have been better if I had died,” Olya’s father, Valeriy Kozyr said at the local cemetery as he prepared to bury her and his son-in-law. “Oh God, you cannot punish me like this. To leave the father and take the children!” he told the Reuters news agency as he wept. Wiping tears from his face, the 61-year-old explained that he must now work out how to care for his three grandchildren aged 10, 15 and 17.  He said he was not in the cafe at the time of the attack because he worked night shifts as a security guard, and so was spared. “Half the village is gone, families are gone,” said Kozyr, standing beside his wife as she wept. “All the time they miss. Well, this time, they hit. Now I’ll have to cross out half my phone book.” Nearby, three brothers were readying a plot in which to bury their parents, both killed in what President Volodymr Zelenskyy has called a “deliberate” Russian assault on civilians.  Ukrainian officials say early findings suggest that Russia used an Iskander missile in the attack on the village of about 330 people. “From every family, from every household, there were people present at this commemoration,” Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko told Ukrainian television. “This is a terrible tragedy.” On Friday, the UN human rights office spokeswoman Elizabeth Throssell also said that “given the location, given the fact that the cafe was struck, the indications are that it was a Russian missile.” But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Friday denied that Russia was responsible for the attack in Hroza and repeated that the Russian military does not target civilian facilities.  Reporting on Friday from the site of the attack, Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi said Hroza’s tiny community “has been absolutely devastated” by the attack. “You can still smell the blood in the air, the blood that was soaked up by the ground from the bodies that were strewn all over,” he said. “The building that was hit is unrecognisable, completely gone. There is just rubble,” Basravi added, standing next to a massive mound of broken concrete blocks, twisted metal and shattered glass. “There are clothes, children’s toys … patches of blood where bodies were pulled out and were laying here.” Not all of the victims have been identified. Regional police investigator Serhiy Bolvinov told reporters late on Thursday that authorities would have to use DNA to identify some of the victims, because their remains were beyond recognition. “Corpses lay there in that yard, and nobody could identify them,” said Valentyna Kozienko, 73, speaking near her home close to the site. As darkness fell on Thursday, dazed emergency crews carried bodies placed in white bags onto the back of a pick-up truck. A local man knelt dnd wept as he lay his hand on the remains of a loved one before they too, were taken away. Resident Oleksandr Mukhovatyi said he lost his mother, brother and sister-in-law. “Someone betrayed us. The attack was precise, it all landed in the coffee shop.”"
‘Pop­ulist ap­proach’. Can the Con­ser­v­a­tives win an­oth­er UK elec­tion?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/is-the-uk-conservative-partys-governance-working,"Par­ty, which held a di­vi­sive con­fer­ence this week, has been in pow­er for 13 years but is strug­gling in opin­ion polls.","In the middle of this week’s Conservative Party conference, a United Kingdom research company published a survey on attitudes towards Britain’s ruling party. “Useless”, “rubbish”, “bad”, “incompetent” and “corrupt” were the most prominent terms that appeared on a Savanta UK word cloud after it asked 2,000 people to describe the right-wing party, led by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. In power since 2010, the party has long been a beleaguered force. Currently on its fifth leader in 13 years, it has been buffeted by several scandals, high-profile resignations and accusations of incompetence. And if its plunging poll ratings are to be believed, the party is on course to suffer a chastening defeat to the opposition Labour Party at the next general election. “They might want to try something other than populist messages – stopping small [refugee and migrant] boats and abandoning climate commitments – and focus on the cost-of-living crisis and have a better understanding of what people actually need and want now,” James Mitchell, a professor at the University of Edinburgh’s School of Social and Political Science, told Al Jazeera. “The populist approach does not appear to be working no matter which iteration is tried.” During her conference speech, Home Secretary Suella Braverman double-downed on her anti-immigration stance by warning that a “hurricane” of mass migration was heading Britain’s way. Braverman has made repelling refugees and migrants trying to cross the English Channel her priority, prompting many on the left to accuse her of deliberately stoking fears on immigration. Such rhetoric, together with Sunak’s policies regarding the environment – which last monthsaw him accusedof rolling back crucial climate targets – have polarised a country still reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic, a sharp cost-of-living crisis and its divisive exit from the European Union in 2020. But while “populism” has yet to reverse the party’s desperate position in the polls, the Conservatives are hoping to benefit just in time for the election itself, which is scheduled to take place no later than January 2025. “They’re hoping to get back some of those more culturally conservative voters who, owing to the dire state of the economy and public services, are now tempted to vote for opposition parties,” Tim Bale, a politics professor at Queen Mary University of London, told Al Jazeera. They also want to win over the few voters who had been tempted by the “radical right-wing populist Reform party”, he said.   In Scotland, where the devolved Scottish National Party (SNP) government has been at loggerheads with the UK government over its wish to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence, the Conservatives hope that their position on Britain’s North Sea oil and gas industry will eat into the SNP’s current stranglehold on Scottish politics. In the UK Parliament in Westminster, the SNP currently hold the vast majority of Scottish seats. In September, Sunak gave the go-ahead for extraction to begin off Scotland at Rosebank, the largest untapped oilfield in the North Sea, despite opposition from Scotland’s SNP first minister,Humza Yousaf, who accused the Conservatives of “climate denial”. “The [UK] election is all to play for,” said Scottish Conservative voter Iain McGill, who has also stood as a candidate for the party. “For example, the Conservatives want to get every last drop of our oil and gas and use it. The [SNP] want to close down this massively important part of the economy, shed the jobs and investment and energy security they bring, to import it from overseas.” But with the party about 20 points behind Labour in the polls, hopes are rising among Britain’s anti-Conservative voters. “I’m not happy with how the UK government has been treating refugees, migrants and asylum seekers,” said Sarah Unsworth, a project manager from Bristol in southwestern England. “I think they have been using some quite damaging, divisive and poisonous language and normalising something which is quite harmful to our society.” Unsworth told Al Jazeera that she plans to cast her ballot for the Labour Party but added: “My vote would be very much against the Conservative Party rather than a vote in support of Labour.” Sunak has sparked an uproar in many quarters with his conference speech on Wednesday. He announced he isscrappingthe northern English leg of the so-called HS2 high-speed rail project and upset some among the LGBTQ community by stating that Britons should not be “bullied into believing that people can be any sex they want to be”. The stakes for his party are high, Bale said, explaining that once power is lost in Westminster, it’s usually lost for many years. “Look at the [UK election] pattern we’ve seen since 1979,” he said.“A Conservative government for 18 years, followed by a Labour government for 13 years, then a Conservative or Conservative-led government for 13 years. It doesn’t bode well, … does it?”"
"Fo­cus on mi­gra­tion, en­large­ment as EU lead­ers meet in Spain",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/european-union-leaders-meet-in-granada-to-discuss-enlargement-migration,Sum­mit comes a day af­ter dozens of Eu­ro­pean lead­ers pledged con­tin­ued sup­port for Ukraine in fight against Rus­sia.,"European Union leaders are in the southern Spanish city of Granada for an informal summit focused on the 27-member bloc’s enlargement, disagreements over migration and economic competitiveness. Friday’s summit comes a day after leaders of the European Political Community, a forum of more than 40 countries across the continent, met in the city and pledged their continued support for Ukraine in the presence of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The pledge was made as fears grow in Ukraine that political turmoil in theUnited States could delay or preventfurther aid to the country in its fight against Russia’s invasion. A rift between Ukraine and Poland over Ukrainian grain exports has also raised questions over whether the EU’s support to Kyiv is waning. But EU leaders reassured Zelenskyy that the bloc’s long-term support will continue. In aninvitation lettersent to the EU’s 27 leaders before Friday’s summit, EU Council President Charles Michel said the meeting wouldbe “a time to look back and critically assess progress in strengthening our European sovereignty, identifying our achievements as well as areas that still require our political action”. He added that “it is also the time to look forward, identifying the future challenges”. An issue that has been a challenge for the bloc to agree on has been enlargement. Eight countries have official EU candidate status: Turkey, Ukraine, Moldova, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia. Georgia and Kosovo are potential candidate countries. “Enlargement means that the candidate countries have reforms to implement. They know what they need to do. And on the EU side, we need to get prepared. This is the first time in many years that you have a high-level debate on such a fundamental topic and such fundamental decisions,” Michel told reporters in Granada on arriving at the summit.  Michel said new member countries should be welcomed in by 2030. Last month, the presidents of Serbia, Kosovo, Bosnia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Albania also said that enlargement should happen “not later than 2030”. But EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has insisted that “accession is merit-based”. She says the progress these countries make in aligning their laws with EU rules and standards should dictate the pace of membership rather than some arbitrary deadline. The bureaucratic pace of aligning with thousands of EU rules can sometimes take well over a half-dozen years. In a document seen by the Reuters news agency, the leaders are expected to say in a joint statement at the end of the summit that “the future of our aspiring members and their citizens lies within the European Union”. The Granada meeting will also steer discussions in the coming months on European Commission proposals that could lead to tighter controls of exports and technologies, particularly those that could be put to military use. Michel plans to work with EU members to assess by the end of the year whether there are any risks to the bloc’s economic security linked to advanced semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum technology and biotechnology. Moreover, southern EU nations are keen to address immigration challenges as refugee arrivals and deaths at sea are increasing. On Wednesday, the blocstruck a dealto implement changes to handle irregular immigration during times of high arrivals. The bloc hopes to put those changes into law before the next round of EU elections ushers in an expected shift to the right as support grows across the continent for political parties that have railed against immigration. But on Friday Poland and Hungary expressed outrage at the planned changes. Poland’s populist government, facing a general election next week, lashed out at Europe’s plans for overhauling the rules on asylum seekers and irregular migrants as a “diktat” from Brussels and Berlin. “We are not afraid of diktats … from Berlin and Brussels,” said Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki on arrival for the Granada meeting. “The plan is to admit illegal immigrants to countries that don’t want to accept them and to impose draconian penalties… Poland strongly rejects this.” Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban went even further, describing the proposed legislation, which obliges EU states to take in a share of migrants or pay those who do so, as tantamount to being “legally raped”. “There’s no chance of having any kind of compromise and agreement on migration. Politically, it’s impossible … because legally we were – how to say it – we were raped,” he said of the rejection of Hungary and Poland’s stance."
"‘They killed us, how can we live with them in peace?’",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/ethnic-armenians-who-fled-karabakh,"Hav­ing fled Nagorno-Karabakh, eth­nic Ar­me­ni­ans say they won’t re­turn as they bank on more sup­port from Yere­van.","Yerevan, Armenia –Alisa Ghazaryan was full of excitement and nerves as she started her first year at university in Stepanakert, having moved from her village home in Nagorno-Karabakh. But just as term began, Azerbaijani forces began shelling the city, which Baku knows as Khankendi, onSeptember 19. As they carried out what they cast as an “anti-terrorist operation”, the 18-year-old took shelter in the university’s basement. “I was born there, I grew up there,” she said of her home. “When I was there, I felt completely free.” Until recently, Nagorno-Karabakh, a long-troubled mountainous enclave, was home to about 120,000 ethnic Armenians who dominated the region. Since Baku’s lightning offensive, more than 100,000, including Alisa, have fled to Armenia. Despite assurances by Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev to protect their civil rights, many say they feared persecution after years of mutual distrust and open hatred between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Several displaced people Al Jazeera spoke to in Armenia said they were expecting a massacre. According to ethnic Armenian officials, at least 200 people were killed in Baku’s assault, including 10 civilians, and more than 400 were wounded. Baku played down the claims of civilian casualties but acknowledged “collateral damage” was possible. Azerbaijan, which announced that 192 of its soldiers were killed in the operation, said its blitz was aimed at disarming ethnic Armenian separatists in the region, parts of which now resemble a ghost town. Al Jazeera was unable to verify either side’s toll. The assault came after a 10-month blockade, effectively imposed by Azerbaijan after it closed the Lachin corridor to Armenia, preventing the flow of food, fuel and medicine. Baku had accused Armenia of funnelling weapons to separatists through the winding, mountain road, a claim denied by both parties. The local unrecognised government surrendered after 24 hours of fighting. Aliyev said his “iron fist” restored Azerbaijan’s sovereignty. Late last month, Nagorno-Karabakh’s ethnic Armenian officialssaidthe region will cease to exist as a self-styled breakaway republic on January 1 next year. Alisa and her family fled through the Lachin corridor, which has since been reopened. They are staying at a friend’s house outside the Armenian capital, Yerevan. Fourteen people currently live in the cramped space, sharing two rooms. At night, they sleep side by side on the living room floor. “We are only here to not be on the streets,” said Alisa. It’s a far cry from their house in Karabakh, which they had just finished renovating. The journey to Armenia, which usually takes several hours, took days for some, as people poured out of the region. The European Parliament this week said the “current situation amounts to ethnic cleansing”. Those who left are scattered across Armenia, facing an uncertain future and mourning the loss of their homeland. Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognised as Azerbaijan’s territory, including by Armenia. The ex-Soviet rivals have fought two wars over the enclave, in the nineties and in 2020. The first conflict saw ethnic Armenians seize swaths of land, resulting in the displacement of Azerbaijanis, while Baku triumphed in the 2020 war. Since then, Russian peacekeepers have operated in the region, but Armenians blame them for allowing Azerbaijan’s latest attack, which was widely condemned in the West. Now, there are only a few hundred left in Karabakh, mainly elderly or disabled people. “The nature was so beautiful. There are mountains and forests. Our home was right on the edge of a forest, we used to walk there a lot,” said Alisa, as she looked at a photo on her phone of a verdant hillside. Ina, her mother, wanted to throw away the key to their house, but Alisa begged her not to. “Maybe one day we will go back, maybe when I am an old woman,” Alisa said hopefully. “Aliyev describes us and our heroes as terrorists, but in reality, he is the terrorist. I want the world to know that Artsakh is our motherland and not [Azerbaijan’s],” she added, using the self-styled name for the region. Many of those displaced had already fled, in previous wars. Angela Sazkisjan-Yan, a glamorous 65-year-old, left Baku in 1995. “Nobody would stay [in Karabakh] because everybody clearly knows the handwriting of Azerbaijan,” she said. Some people destroyed their furniture or dishes before they left, but Angela cleaned her flat in Stepanakert, and even left the refrigerator on and filled with food, perhaps a symbolic gesture of her hope to one day return. “Everybody left their property but that’s a small part of it – the worst part is that we left our homeland, our roots. Even my grandparents are buried there,” she told Al Jazeera in Abovyan, northeast of Yerevan. She is staying with her sister’s family, whom she had not seen in two years. “I am very happy to rejoin with them because we are an inseparable part of each other, but I have a big soul ache for everything that’s happened,” she said. Many Armenians living in Nagorno-Karabakh say they were split up from relatives during the blockade. Lilit Shahverdyan, a 20-year-old freelance journalist, was in Yerevan with her sister during the tensions, while the rest of her family was at their home in Stepanakert. “We just hugged each other and started to cry,” she said, describing the moment when she finally saw her family, in the border town of Goris, after almost a year apart. She said the blockade made her family closer and stronger than ever. “All we have now is just our family and just one apartment in Yerevan. Everything else – not just the property, but all our memories, life goals, and the future was in our homeland – now it’s all gone.” As her mother locked their front door for the last time in Stepanakert, tears streamed down her face. “It was the most beautiful house. My father built it 10 years ago. I really enjoyed waking up there every day just going to the garden, hugging my cats or talking to my neighbours. In my childhood, everything was connected to that house.” Lilit had hoped to return to Stepanakert to work after she finishes her university course in Yerevan. Now, she wants to leave Armenia altogether. “I’m just afraid that some sh** will happen again. And I don’t want my kids to suffer as much as I did. Armenia is not a safe place as long as we have a neighbouring dictator and we have this government. I don’t want to have another traumatised generation,” she said. Hopes of a peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan seem to be fading after a crucial meeting planned for this week, between Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, was cancelled by Azerbaijan at the last minute. “It’s not only unrealistic, it’s also a crime to believe that now is the time to collaborate on a peaceful relationship,” said Angela, who said she knows 10 people who were killed in the recent fighting. “They killed us, how can we live with them in peace?” Ara Papian, an Armenian lawyer and former diplomat, thinks further aggression by Azerbaijan is possible in the future, particularly in the Syunik region where Azerbaijan wants to build a corridor through Armenian territory to connect with its exclave, Nakhchivan. Even if a peace treaty is signed, Azerbaijan will “find an excuse and attack”, he predicted. Papian accused the West of refusing to condemn and sanction Azerbaijan because some nations do not want to get on the wrong side of NATO member Turkey – Azerbaijan’s closest ally. The European Union’s gas deal with Azerbaijan exposes the bloc’s hypocrisy, he added. “The EU and the West do not buy oil and gas from dictator [Russian President Vladimir] Putin to not fuel the war in Ukraine, but they buy the same from Azerbaijan knowing that the money will go not to prosperity of people in Azerbaijan, it will become new weapons, which means a new war – which has happened.” Housing is now the main priority for displaced people, said Margarit Piliposyan, deputy country director for the NGO Fund for Armenia Relief (FAR), which has been distributing food and humanitarian supplies in Vayk, a town south of Yerevan. The Armenian government recently announced financial support for displaced people with 100,000 dram per person ($239) and then 40,000 dram per month ($96) for six months for housing costs. However, several people told Al Jazeera they were yet to see any government assistance, such as Lira Arzangulyan, 33, and Alina Khachatryan, 31, two sisters, who fled after the latest escalation. They moved with their four children and mothers-in-law, to Mrgavan village, in Artashat, a province in the shadow of Mount Ararat, where more than 100 displaced families now live. They were previously displaced from their home in Martuni after the 2020 war. The house is small with peeling wallpaper and one gas stove. It is cold inside – even on a mild September day. The owner is letting them stay there for free, for now. “We don’t have any other place to go so we’re going to stay here. The houses for rent are too expensive, we can’t afford it. We are still uncertain and in shock,” said Alina. The children play in the other room as their mothers cry softly. Lira’s mascara runs across her cheek as she says how much she misses visiting her mother’s grave in Karabakh. They both lament the Russian peacekeepers, who Lira described as being “indifferent and doing nothing” to protect or help them. The first United Nations monitoring mission visited Karabakh on Sunday. “Why didn’t they come when we had nothing to eat? It is empty now, there is no one living there. If they came before this escalation started and they gave us hope and a guarantee that there is someone to support us, then we would have stayed there,” said Lira. Their children run in and hug them close. “I hope this next generation will change and maybe when our kids grow up they will be able to go back there, maybe as a tourist, to see where they’re from,” Alina added."
Who are the 2023 No­bel Prize win­ners so far?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/who-are-the-2023-nobel-prize-winners-so-far,"This year’s lau­re­ates have opened doors for dis­ease con­trol, tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vance­ments and sub­ver­sive lit­er­a­ture.","This week marks the announcement ofNobel Prizes for 2023. The six prizes recognise individuals and groups for their contributions to particular fields. Here is some information about this year’s winners and why they won:  The US-based duo won theNobel Prize in physiology or medicineon Monday for research that led directly to the first mRNA vaccines to fight COVID-19. The Hungarian-born Kariko and American Weissman conducted research at the University of Pennsylvania on modifying mRNA. They started looking into this in the late 1990s and published a key finding in 2005. According to the awarding body, the Karolinska Institute, this research enabled the development of COVID-19 vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna. The trio won theprize in physicson Tuesday for conducting experiments that produced pulses of light so short that they were measured in attoseconds, or one-billionth of one-billionth of a second. Their research can help provide images from inside atoms and molecules. The breakthrough allows, for example, for blood samples to be examined with light flashes to detect any changes, opening the possibility of early detection of diseases such as lung cancer. L’Huillier is only the fifth woman to win a Nobel in physics. The trio won theaward in chemistryon Wednesday for the discovery and synthesis of quantum dots. Quantum dots are particles that are so small that their properties are determined by quantum phenomena. Researchers believe that this technology can pave the way for the development of flexible electronics, tiny sensors, thinner solar cells and encrypted quantum communication. In a very unusual turn of events, Swedish media reported the names of the winners before the prize was announced. Theprize in literaturewas awarded to the Norwegian author and dramatist John Fosse on Thursday. Fosse was recognised by the Swedish Academy “for his innovative plays and prose which give voice to the unsayable”. Fosse, 64, has written about 40 plays as well as novels, short stories, children’s books, poetry and essays. His work has been translated into about 50 languages. The Iranian rights activist won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday. She was chosen from 351 nominees. Mohammadi, who has been has served multiple prison sentences for the past two decades, is best known for her fight for freedom and against oppression of Iranian women. “Woman, life, freedom,” said Berit Reiss-Andersen, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. She recited the slogan that is now associated with the women’s movement in Iran as she announced Mohammadi as the winner. One Nobel remains. The prize for economics will be announced on Monday."
Pres­sure on Egypt’s econ­o­my mounts af­ter down­grade,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/10/6/egypts-bonds-spiral-lower-after-moodys-downgrade-over-economic-woes,The agency says Egypt’s wors­en­ing debt af­ford­abil­i­ty led to its de­ci­sion to cut the coun­try’s cred­it rat­ing.,"Egypt’s sovereign dollar bonds have tumbled after ratings agency Moody’s downgraded the country’s credit rating deeper into junk territory, ramping up the pressure on the cash-strapped nation as it heads intoelectionsin December. On Thursday, Moody’s moved Egypt down one notch to “Caa1” from “B3”, seven levels into junk, citing the country’s worsening debt affordability. The country is in the throes of a bruisingeconomic crisis, with record inflation, crushing government debt and a plunging currency that has driven more of its citizens to seek risky routes out of the country. All of Egypt’s sovereign dollar bonds slid lower, with most trading at their lowest since May. Egypt has downgraded its pound currency to half its former value in the year to March. However, on Thursday, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Director Kristalina Georgieva told Bloomberg that Egypt will continue to “bleed” reserves unless it devalues again. Georgieva also told Bloomberg there had been “constructive engagements” with Egypt, adding that she expected “more systematic work” between the IMF team and the government in the coming weeks. Egyptians are expected to go to the polls to select their president on December 10-12. A handful of politicians have already announced their bids to run for the country’s highest post, but none poses a serious challenge toPresident Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has been in power since 2014 – a year after overthrowing the country’s first democratically elected President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood.  Meanwhile, at least two Egyptian banks this week suspended the use of Egyptian pound debit cards outside the country to stop a drain on foreign currency. Arab African International Bank sent a notice to customers on Wednesday and Arab International Bank sent one on Thursday announcing the suspension, according to several customers speaking to the Reuters news agency. A customer representative for Arab African International Bank confirmed the move, saying it was due to the country’s foreign exchange shortage, Reuters reported. One banker in Egypt said all banks were facing similar problems as a result of the currency shortage, but that each was taking decisions separately. A substantial number of debit card holders had been using cards to make bulk purchases, often in the United Arab Emirates, of gold, mobile telephones and other products to take advantage of the Egyptian pound’s low official exchange rate. Debit card transactions are charged at the official rate of about 31 pounds to the dollar whereas on the black market, a dollar sells for approximately 40 pounds. Egypt has kept its currency fixed against the dollar since March despite a widening gap with the black market rate. “Sometimes they just send the cards (without leaving Egypt), and they buy things with them. You find there are four or five people from the same family,” the banker told Reuters. Other banks were likely to introduce similar restrictions next week, the banker added. Banks in recent months have also been tightening up on the amount of foreign currency clients can buy in Egypt and on how much they can charge to their credit cards while abroad."
"Syr­ia mourns Homs drone vic­tims as gov’t, Russ­ian at­tacks in Idlib kill 11",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/syria-mourns-dozens-of-people-killed-in-homs-drone-attack,Fu­ner­als held for vic­tims of at­tack on mil­i­tary acad­e­my dur­ing grad­u­a­tion cer­e­mo­ny.,"Eleven civilians, including a two-year-old child, have been killed in opposition-held Idlib, as Syrians began burying the dozens of people killed in Thursday’s large-scale drone attack on a military academy in the western city of Homs. Government forces stepped up shelling and missile attacks on Idlib after the Homs strike, the deadliest attack on government-held territory in years. Fourteen people were killed by government attacks in Idlib on Thursday, according to the Syrian Civil Defence, before three more were killed on Friday. The two-year-old child was killed in a Russian air attack on a family home in the village of Jaftallak Haj Hamoud, north of Jisr al-Shughour, according to the Civil Defence, medics and locals. A married couple was among four people killed in Idlib city, where Syrian government artillery hit residential neighbourhoods on Friday evening. Friday prayers were cancelled by authorities in opposition-held areas of Idlib and Aleppo, out of fear that mosques could be attacked. The bombardment has left civilians fearful of what may come in the next few days. “I was sleeping and suddenly the sounds of a strong explosion rang out,” said Muhammad al-Sameeh, a resident of Termanin, where four people were killed. “It was like judgement day… It turned out that there was bombing in our neighborhood. I felt very afraid. We were already displaced because of the bombing and military escalation, but it followed us here. Now we have to move again, but I don’t know where to.” The bombardment of rebel territory came as mourners took to the streets in Homs on Friday, with coffins draped in Syrian flags laid outside the Homs military hospital as a military band played sombre music and soldiers saluted. On Thursday, several dronesattackeda graduation ceremony in the academy’s courtyard, where families had gathered with the new officers. Syria’s Ministry of Health said at least 89 people had been killed, including 31 women and five children. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the Syrian conflict, put the toll at more than 120. Syria has declared three days of national mourning. There have been no claims of responsibility for the attack, and Syria’s Ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs and Expatriates blamed what they described as “terrorist” groups without providing specifics. They promised to respond “with full force”. Thursday’s attack was an unprecedented use of drones against government forces in the war, which began with protests against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011 and spiralled into a conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions. Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, who has reported extensively on Syria, said the attack represented “a major security breach, a blow to the Syrian regime”. “It has been years since the forces of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, have been targeted in such an operation in the heart of government-controlled territory,” she said. “It seems that the Syrian regime is blaming the opposition because just moments after this attack, their planes started to target residential areas in the opposition-controlled enclaves in the northwest of the country,” she added.  United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “expressed deep concern” about the drone attack in Homs, as well as “reports of retaliatory shelling” in northwest Syria, his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. Meanwhile, Russian President and Syrian government ally Vladimir Putin sent his condolences to al-Assad, Lebanese station Al-Manar reported on Friday.

Why is Pak­istan plan­ning to de­port un­doc­u­ment­ed Afghans?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/why-is-pakistan-deporting-undocumented-afghans,Afghan gov­ern­ment has called Pak­istan’s de­ci­sion to ex­pel Afghans liv­ing in the coun­try with­out ap­proval ‘un­ac­cept­able’.,"Islamabad, Pakistan– Pakistan’s government hasannouncedthat all undocumented migrants and refugees must leave Pakistan by the beginning of next month, either voluntarily or by force. Hundreds of thousands of them are Afghans. Citing a rising number of violent attacks, caretaker Interior Minister Sarfraz Bugti said on Tuesday that “14 out of 24” suicide bombings this year were carried out by Afghan nationals. “We have given them a deadline of November 1,” Bugti said, adding that nearly 4.4 million Afghan refugees live in the country – more than 1.7 million illegally. Here’s what you need to know about the government’s decision: Pakistan has seen a dramaticsurge in violencethis year with the majority of attacks occurring in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the southwestern province of Balochistan, both of which border Afghanistan. The government has repeatedly alleged that the Afghan Taliban is giving safe harbour to fighters belonging to the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which is ideologically aligned with the Afghan Taliban. Since the TTP’s decision to renege on a peace accord with the Pakistani government in November, the group has launched more than 300 attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province alone this year. The frequency and intensity of the attacks have been increasing. Thetwolatestattacksin Balochistan’s Mastung city and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Hangu city last month killed more than 60 people and wounded dozens. Kabul, for its part, has denied the allegations, saying security concerns in Pakistan have nothing to do with Afghans. The interim Afghan government led by the Taliban gave a stinging rebuke of Pakistan’s announcement, calling it “unacceptable”. Government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid on Wednesday responded to Bugti’s remarks, urging the Pakistani government to “reconsider the decision“. Afghan refugees are not involved in Pakistan’s security problems, he said on X, formerly known as Twitter, adding that Pakistan “should tolerate them”. Pakistan sent a high-level delegation to Kabul for negotiations, the second such visit this year, and urged the Afghan Taliban to improve border controls. The two countries share a 2,640km-long (1,640-mile-long) border. It passes through rugged mountains, densely forested valleys and narrow rock passages. Its topography makes it porous and difficult to control.  Pakistan has conducted similar operations in the past, albeit with limited success. During a 2016 campaign, more than 600,000 Afghan immigrants, both registered and undocumented, returned to their country, according to data compiled by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). A Human Rights Watch report from 2017 called it the “world’s largest unlawful mass forced return of refugees in recent times”. That year saw the exodus of 150,000 Afghans while in 2018, after at least six extensions to a deadline to leave the country, almost 50,000 Afghan citizens, both registered and undocumented, were expelled, according to the UNHCR. At that time, Islamabad made similar allegations that TTP fighters were using Afghan soil to launch attacks in Pakistan, and it carried out campaigns to expel immigrants, citing security concerns. According to estimates, more than 95 percent of refugees in Pakistan, both documented and undocumented, are Afghan nationals. The first influx of refugees began after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, which resulted in more than three million Afghans fleeing to Pakistan. Over the years, many of them returned home. This wave was followed by a second in 2001 when the United States invaded Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks. The UNHCR says 1.3 million Afghan refugees live in Pakistan, 50 percent of whom are in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and 24 percent in Balochistan. A report released in July by Refugees International, an independent humanitarian group that advocates for displaced people, said that since thefall of Kabul to the Taliban in 2021, more than 600,000 Afghans have fled to Pakistan.  The government has not disclosed any plans about how it intends to deport undocumented people. The task to identify them has been given to the Ministry of Interior Affairs, and regional police and the Federal Investigation Agency are to carry out the deportations. Authorities have said a task force will be created to initiate the crackdown after the November 1 deadline, and those Afghans who do not have documentation will be handed over to Afghan officials unless they are wanted by authorities for suspected criminal activities."
"Biden ad­min­is­tra­tion to ex­tend US bor­der wall, be­gin Venezuela de­por­ta­tions",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/biden-administration-to-extend-us-border-wall-begin-venezuela-deportations,Pres­i­dent Joe Biden’s gov­ern­ment to car­ry for­ward a sig­na­ture pol­i­cy of for­mer Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.,"The administration of US President Joe Biden will resume deporting Venezuelan migrants, and add sections to the southern border wall, carrying forward a signature policy of former President Donald Trump. Washington’s announcement came on Thursday, two weeks after Bidenextendedtemporary legal status to more than 470,000 Venezuelans living in the United States, saying that “the conditions in their home country prevent their safe return”. The Venezuelan migrants were the largest single group encountered at the US-Mexico border last month. The US government is under political pressure to stem the flow of people. For more than a year, Texas Governor Greg Abbotthas been busing migrantsfrom the southern US border to places like New York, Washington and Chicago, prompting angry complaints from Democratic officials in those cities. One of Biden’s first actions after taking office in January 2021 was to issue a proclamation pledging that “no more American taxpayer dollars be diverted to construct a border wall” as well as a review of all resources that had already been committed. The administration said Thursday’s action did not deviate from Biden’s proclamation because money that was allocated duringTrump’s termin 2019 had to be spent now. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement that there was “no new Administration policy with respect to border walls. From day one, this Administration has made clear that a border wall is not the answer”. Mayorkas said the construction project was appropriated during the prior administration and the law requires the government to use the funds, with an announcement made earlier in the year. “We have repeatedly asked Congress to rescind this money but it has not done so and we are compelled to follow the law,” he said. Trump, however, was quick to claim victory and demand an apology. “As I have stated often, over thousands of years, there are only two things that have consistently worked, wheels, and walls!” Trump wrote on social media. “Will Joe Biden apologise to me and America for taking so long to get moving …” Immigration will likely be a campaign theme in the US presidential race with a majority of Americans – 54 percent – agreeing with the statement that “immigration is making life harder for native-born Americans”, a September Reuters/Ipsos poll found. About 73 percent of Republicans and 37 percent of Democrats surveyed agreed with that statement. The Biden administration’s decision to move forward with the border barriers will open the president to criticism from his left-leaning base, including immigration advocates and environmentalists opposed to more construction. In a notice published in the Federal Register on Thursday, Biden’s Department of Homeland Security said it needed to waive several laws, regulations and other legal requirements to construct barriers in Starr County, Texas. The county is in Rio Grande Valley Sector where Border Patrol agents have encountered more than 245,000 people entering the US this fiscal year, Mayorkas said in the Federal Register post. “There is presently an acute and immediate need to construct physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the border of the United States in order to prevent unlawful entries,” he said. About 11 million immigrants are in the US without legal documentation, says the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute. Many have lived and worked in the country for years or decades. Biden tried early in his tenure to get a comprehensive immigration reform bill passed in Congress, but Republican opposition thwarted progress."
‘Vic­to­ry is near’: Jailed Iran­ian ac­tivist wins No­bel Peace Prize,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/irans-narges-mohammadi-wins-2023-nobel-peace-prize,Narges Mo­ham­ma­di is ho­n­oured for her fight against ‘the op­pres­sion of women’ in Iran at ‘tremen­dous per­son­al costs’.,"Narges Mohammadi, a jailed Iranian women’s rights advocate, has won the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize for her courageous struggle against the oppression of women in Iran and relentless fight for social reform. While behind bars, she was awarded the prestigious prize on Friday for her efforts “to promote human rights and freedom for all”, according to the Norwegian Nobel Committee. “Her brave struggle has come with tremendous personal costs. Altogether, the regime has arrested her 13 times, convicted her five times, and sentenced her to a total of 31 years in prison and 154 lashes,” Berit Reiss-Andersen, head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said in Oslo during the announcement. Mohammadi, 51, is one of Iran’s leading human rights activists who has campaigned for women’s rights and the abolition of the death penalty. She is currently serving multiple sentences inTehran’s notorious Evin prisonamounting to about 12 years imprisonment, according to the Front Line Defenders rights organisation, one of the many periods she has been detained behind bars. Charges include spreading propaganda against the state. Mohammadi is the deputy head of the Defenders of Human Rights Center, a non-governmental organisationled by Shirin Ebadi, the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize laureate. She told The New York Times after the win she would never stop striving for democracy and equality – even if that meant staying in prison. “I will continue to fight against the relentless discrimination, tyranny and gender-based oppression by the oppressive religious government until the liberation of women,” the newspaper quoted her as saying in a statement. “I also hope this recognition makes Iranians protesting for change stronger and more organised. Victory is near.” Tehran accused the Nobel committee of meddling and politicising the issue of human rights. “The action of the Nobel Peace Committee is political move in line with the interventionist and anti-Iranian policies of some European governments,” Nasser Kanaani, a spokesperson for Iran’s Foreign Ministry, said. “The Nobel Peace committee has awarded a prize to a person convicted of repeated law violations and criminal acts, and we condemn this as biased and politically motivated,” he added in a statement carried by state media.  Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute in Oslo, told Al Jazeera after the announcement it was “a very important prize, one that is celebrating the achievements of human rights defenders, specifically women’s rights defenders in Iran, which has been a very troubled country”. “This is a prize that is also focusing on the sacrifices of young people in Iran. It is a way of underlining their sacrifices and the challenges human rights defenders are operating under in Iran,” he said. Mohammadi’s award comes after a wave of protests swept Iran following the death in custody a year ago of ayoung Iranian Kurd, Mahsa Amini, arrested for violating Iran’s strict dress rules for women. Iran is ranked 143rd out of 146 countries on the World Economic Forum’s gender equality ranking. Tehran rejects accusations of discrimination against women. Mohammadi is the 19th woman to win the 122-year-old prize. The Norwegian Nobel Committee picked this year’s winner from 351 candidates, including 259 individuals and 92 organisations. Olive Moore, Interim Director at Front Line Defenders, said, “This Nobel Peace Prize is a resounding recognition of Narges Mohammadi and other women human rights defenders who – at great cost to personal liberty – have courageously advocated for Iranian women to enjoy the full range of human rights and freedoms”. Mohammadi’s brother Hamidreza said he has not been in touch with his sister but the Nobel Peace Prize “means a lot to her”. He added, however, it is unlikely to make a difference in Iran. “The prize means that the world has seen this movement, [but] the award will not affect the situation in Iran,” he said. “The regime will double down on the opposition, and it will have no effect on the regime. They will just crush people.” The head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee urged Iran to release Mohammadi. “I appeal to Iran: Do something dignified and release the Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi,” committee chairwoman Berit Reiss-Andersen said. Incarcerated this time since November 2021, Mohammadi has not seen her children – who live in France with her husband – for eight years. She is considered a “prisoner of conscience” by Amnesty International. Mohammadi’s family said the Nobel Peace Prize was a “historic and profound moment for Iran’s fight for freedom”, while the United Nations called for “her release and the release of all human rights defenders jailed in Iran”. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said the award underscored the bravery of Iranian women. “They’ve been harassed for what they do or don’t wear. There are increasingly stringent legal, social and economic measures against them. This really is something that highlights the courage and determination of the women of Iran and how they are an inspiration to the world,” said OHCHR spokesperson Elizabeth Throssell. Last year, the prize went to human rights advocate Ales Bialiatski from Belarus, the Russian human rights group Memorial and the Ukrainian human rights organisation Center for Civil Liberties. The winners had for many years promoted the right to criticise power and protect the fundamental rights of citizens, the committee said at the time, which came during the first year of Russia’s all-out war in Ukraine. The Peace Prize is the only one of the Nobel prizes to be awarded in Norway’s capital Oslo, rather than Sweden’s capital Stockholm. Over the past week, the medicine, physics, chemistry and literature prizes have been announced. The final prize, for economics, is to be announced on Monday. This year, the prizes are worth 11 million krona ($990,000) in each category. To be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, eligible nominators, including a chancellor, professor, government, and previous winners, among others, must submit a name and explain why they are worthy of the prize. However, there is no official list of the nominees and the names considered are only published 50 years later. After being nominated, an eight-month-long decision-making process is under way, which includes the committee and a group of international advisers who give their expertise on a short list of candidates. The advisers will produce reports by the end of April, which committee members will study, and begin making decisions through midyear. By the beginning of October, the committee will make its decision through a majority vote. This year, there were 351 candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize – the second-highest number of candidates ever – except in 2016, when 376 were nominated. Of those nominated, 259 are individuals and 92 are organisations. It is the eighth straight year with more than 300 nominees. The amount of cash accompanying the Peace Prize jumped 10 percent this year to about $1m. Prize money has risen and fallen over the years. The Nobel Foundation says it increased the amount this year because of its stronger financial position. Winners also walk away with an 18-carat gold medal and a diploma. "
Death toll ris­es to 40 in In­dia’s Sikkim flood­ing af­ter lake over­flow,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/death-toll-rises-to-40-in-indias-sikkim-flooding-after-lake-overflow,Thou­sands are res­cued but dozens re­main miss­ing two days af­ter heavy rain­fall prompt­ed a glacial lake to over­flow.,"The death toll in India’s Sikkim state has risen to 40 after heavy rainfall in the northeastern state caused a glacial lake to overflow and flood surrounding areas with ice-cold water. In one of the worst disasters in the region in 50 years,the floodswashed away houses and bridges, and forced thousands of people to leave their homes on Wednesday. Damage to key infrastructure and continuous rainfall has cut off the capital city, Gangtok, and made rescue operations more difficult. Fifteen bridges in the state have been washed away, including all bridges downstream of an NHPC hydropower station Teesta-V, according to the Indian government. “We are evacuating [people] through helicopters provided by the army and the air force,” Vinay Bhushan Pathak, Sikkim state chief secretary, said on Friday. About 2,400 people have been rescued since Wednesday and 26 injured individuals were taken to hospitals. Rescue workers are stilltrying to locatealmost 100 people, including 23 army personnel. Officials in the neighbouring downstream state of West Bengal told Reuters that emergency teams recovered another 22 bodies that had been washed away. A statement from West Bengal cited by the Press Trust of India also said that the bodies of four army soldiers had been found. However, it was not immediately clear whether they were among the 23missing soldiers. One soldier who had been reported missing on Wednesday was later rescued by authorities, the army said in a statement. More than 22,000 people have been affected by the flood, prompting state authorities to set up 26 relief camps, according to the Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority. About 7,600 people were in relief camps, Tseten Bhutia, a state official, told Reuters. The disaster came ahead of a popular festive and tourism season in the state, leaving nearly 3,000 tourists and 700 taxi drivers stranded, added Pathak. The army said they will use helicopters to try to evacuate 1,500 tourists when the weather improves. In a press conference on Thursday, Pathak said that the tourists were safe in Lachen and Lachung, while the army is also providing them with internet communication so they can advise friends and family that they are safe. He also added that there is no shortage of essential commodities but unsuitable weather conditions are hindering the National Crisis Committee from starting rescue operations. The weather department said Sikkim received 101mm (four inches) of rain in the first five days of October, more than double normal levels, unleashing floods worse than one in October 1968 in which an estimated 1,000 people were killed. “We thought the water level wouldn’t rise as it was very low, but as the water was released from the dam, the levels started to rise slowly and after the dam burst our houses were washed away,” said Keval Tamong, a Sikkim resident. Intense rainfall had caused the high-altitude Lhonak lake to burst and make a Sikkim dam collapse after rushing downstream on Wednesday. The south Lhonak lake has also been rising and putting pressure on the dam in recent years as a warming climate melts source glaciers. Areas affected by the flooding include Dikchu and Rangpo in the Teesta basin. Schools in four districts have also been ordered shut till Sunday, according to the state’s education department. The weather department said Sikkim received 101mm (four inches) of rain in the first five days of October, more than double normal levels, unleashing floods worse than one in October 1968 in which an estimated 1,000 people were killed."

US shoots down Turk­ish drone over Syr­ia af­ter at­tacks near Hasakah,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/us-shoots-down-turkeys-drone-over-syria-after-strikes-near-hasakeh,The in­ci­dent comes as Turkey in­ten­si­fies its mil­i­tary op­er­a­tion in north­ern Syr­ia af­ter a sui­cide bomb­ing in Ankara.,"The Pentagon says United States warplanes have shot down a Turkish drone, which was deemed a threat to its forces in Syria, in an incident that might raise tensions between the NATO allies. The development came on Thursday as TurkeytargetedKurdish forces in Syria following a suicide bombing in Ankara that was claimed by the outlawedKurdistan Workers’ Party(PKK). US troops observed drones carrying out raids on Thursday morning, some of them inside a “restricted operating zone” (ROZ) near Hasakah, about a kilometre (less than a mile) from Washington’s troops, Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder told journalists. A few hours later, a Turkish drone returned to the ROZ and flew towards American forces despite what a US official said were a dozen calls to Ankara’s military. Ryder said “US commanders assessed … the UAV, which was now less than a half kilometre from US forces, to be a potential threat,” using an abbreviation for an unmanned aerial vehicle. “US F-16 fighters subsequently shot down the UAV in self-defence,” he said. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Turkish counterpart Yasar Guler on Thursday, urging “de-escalation in northern Syria and the importance of maintaining strict adherence to de-confliction protocols and communication through established military-to-military channels,” Ryder said in a statement. Turkey’s defence ministry confirmed the call, saying the two officials discussed “the latest developments in Syria”. Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbul, said the UAV did not belong to the Turkish military, according to a statement. “It is not only the Turkish military that conducts counterterrorism operations in northern Iraq and Syria,” she said. She said that the Turkish intelligence and interior ministry’s gendarmerie also joined operations.  On Thursday night, Turkish militaryair attackskilled 26 fighters and destroyed 30 Kurdish fighter targets in northern Syria, including an oil well, a storage facility and shelters, and “neutralised” many fighters, the Turkish defence ministry said. Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from Washington, said Turkish officials say operations are carried out as part of the country’s right to self-defence. “Turkey has warned other countries to stay away from areas controlled by groups it will continue to target,” he said. On Friday, Turkey’s military conducted another round of air strikes in northern Syria and destroyed 15 other targets where it said PKK-affiliate fighters were believed to be, according to the defence ministry. It did not say where in northern Syria the strikes had hit. “As has been done in Iraq, all the capabilities and revenue sources developed by the terrorist organisation in Syria will continue to be destroyed in a systematic way,” the foreign ministry said in a statement. The US has about 900 troops deployed in Syria as part of international efforts to combat the ISIL (ISIS) armed group, and carries out frequent raids targeting the fighters.  US forces are partnered with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which led the fight that dislodged ISIL fighters from the last territory they held in the country in 2019. However, Turkey views the Kurdish People’s Protection Units that dominate the SDF as an offshoot of the PKK, which is considered a “terrorist” group by Ankara and its Western allies. Turkish attacks on military and infrastructure targets in Kurdish-held areas of Syria killed at least nine people on Thursday, according to Kurdish security forces. Syria contains a dangerous mix of often antagonistic forces operating on the ground and in the air, including those from President Bashar al-Assad’s government, Russia, the US, Turkey, Iran-linked armed groups and the Kurdish fighters, among others. Following the drone incident, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan on the phone on Friday. The top US diplomat “highlighted the need to coordinate and deconflict our activities”, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said. Fidan told Blinken that Turkey’s military operations in Syria would continue, a source familiar with the call told Reuters news agency. “During the call, Minister Fidan conveyed to his counterpart Blinken in strong terms that, as an ally, the United States must stop working together with the YPG terrorist organisation in the north of Syria,” the source said."
Rahul plus Sachin: Who is New Zealand’s lat­est crick­et hero Rachin?,https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2023/10/6/who-is-rachin-ravindra-new-zealands-cricket-world-cup-star,Ravin­dra’s sto­ry came full cir­cle as his crick­et-mad par­ents watched him make a World Cup 100 for New Zealand in In­dia.,"Barely two hours into his firstCricket World Cupmatch, Rachin Ravindra was thrown into the limelight by the New Zealand captain and asked tobowl against the tournament’s defending championsat the world’s biggest cricket stadium. The 23-year-old from Wellington duly obliged and came on to bowl his left-arm spin in the 17th over of England’s innings. Three balls in, attacking England batter Harry Brook smacked away Ravindra’s third, fourth and fifth deliveries for two fours and a six. Off the final delivery, Brook attempted another aerial shot but was caught by Ravindra’s hometown teammate Devon Conway. The youngster had his first wicket in an ICC Cricket World Cup. He failed to take any more wickets and gave away 76 runs in his far-from-economical 10-over spell. The all-rounder would have to wait to showcase his skills with the bat and perhaps repay his India-born parents’ faith in naming him after the great Indian batters Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar. “Back in the day when Mum and Dad were deciding on names, they liked Rahul and Sachin. So they took Ra from one and Chin from the other and named me Rachin,” he revealed in a pre-tournament interview with the World Cup broadcaster. “Two amazing players and I’m very lucky to be named after them.”  Back on the field in Ahmedabad, it didn’t take long for another opportunity to come by for Ravindra. With his cricket-mad parents watching in the stands, Ravindra came on to bat less than 10 minutes into New Zealand’s innings. The tall basketball-loving cricketer found himself batting at the position that is usually taken by New Zealand’s most prolific batter Kane Williamson, who is recovering from a knee injury. Unfazed by the occasion and his failure to score off the first six balls, the curly-haired left-handed batter launched into an attack against England’s fast bowler Chris Woakes in the fifth over. Thereon, Ravindra hit five sixes and 11 fours as he raced to an 82-ball-100 – New Zealand’s fastest World Cup century. He finished his innings unbeaten on 123 and shared an unbroken 273-run partnership with his good friend Conway, who top-scored with 152.  Ravindra was named player of the match for his one wicket and 123 runs, and his name was buzzing on social media long after the match was over. “Rachin Ravindra watched the final of the 2019 World Cup in a bar in Bangalore, aged 19. Four years later, he has an 82-ball century in the opening game of the 2023 World Cup,” wrote cricket writer Matt Roller in a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.  Ravindra would later confirm his South Indian roots and said it was “nice to have a connection [with Indian roots] when I am around in Bangalore (Bengaluru) to see my grandparents”. However, when a reporter pressed him on his identity and how sees himself, Ravindra was quick to say: “I am very proud of my roots and ethnicity [but] I completely see myself as a Kiwi.” Ravindra is not new to international cricket, having made his debut in September 2021, and had been marked as one for the future by cricket experts before the World Cup. But with the world’s eyes set on the tournament in India, Ravindra couldn’t have chosen a better opportunity to make his mark and that, too, in front of his idol, Tendulkar, who was watching closely from the stands.

Ex-Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump en­dors­es Jim Jor­dan to be US House Speak­er,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/ex-president-donald-trump-endorses-jim-jordan-to-be-us-house-speaker,The for­mer pres­i­dent backs House Ju­di­cia­ry Com­mit­tee chair­man for the key po­si­tion af­ter re­moval of Kevin Mc­Carthy.,"Former US President Donald Trump has endorsed Congressman Jim Jordan to replace overthrown US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy as the chamber’s fractious Republicans try to unify in the aftermath of McCarthy’s historic fall. “He [Jordan] is STRONG on Crime, Borders, our Military/Vets, & 2nd Amendment. Jim, his wife, Polly, & family are outstanding – He will be a GREAT Speaker of the House, & has my Complete & Total Endorsement!” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social app on Friday. The announcement came hours after Texas Republican Troy Nehls said on Thursday night that Trump had decided to back Jordan’s bid. Two Republican lawmakers arecampaigningfor the speakership: Representative Steve Scalise, who was second to McCarthy on the leadership ladder, and Jordan, an outspoken conservative from Ohio who has led investigations into President Joe Biden’s administration. Republicans, who control the House of Representatives by a narrow 221-212 margin, are due to hold a closed-door forum for candidates seeking the speakership on Tuesday, a meeting that the former Republican president said he could attend. A vote is expected the next day. However, acrimony and resentment overMcCarthy’s removalcould make nominating a new speaker a challenge for House Republicans.  The Truth Social app post follows earlier reports that Trump, the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican nomination to challenge Democratic President Joe Biden, might agree to replace McCarthy for a short time. Trump said he would be open to serving as interim leader himself if Republicans could not settle on a name, according to the Associated Press news agency. Although House rules do not require the speaker to be a member of Congress, Trump already has a lot on his plate as he faces four upcoming criminal trials, two related to his attempts to overturn his 2020 election defeat. House Republican rules prohibit a speaker who is under felony indictment. Trump spent much of the start of the week in New York, where his civil fraud trial was getting under way, with the former reality TV star drawing the spotlight over repeated verbal attacks on the US legal system, drawing a gag order from the judge. Trump’s pull with House Republicans has been tested at times this year. Republicans initially did not respond to Trump’s call to elect McCarthy as speaker, waiting three days before doing so and subjecting McCarthy to 15 rounds of voting. Trump has beenindictedon 91 felony counts in four separate criminal cases including two that accuse him of illegally trying to subvert his 2020 presidential election loss."
The Oc­to­ber 1973 War: How it led to the first Arab recog­ni­tion of Is­rael,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/the-october-1973-war-how-it-led-to-the-first-arab-recognition-of-israel,"Fifty years af­ter the Arab-Is­raeli war, Is­rael con­tin­ues to oc­cu­py the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza.","TheOctober 1973 Arab-Israeli Warlasted for barely three weeks but it shook the world economy and culminated in the Camp David Accords that saw Egypt become the first Arab country to establish diplomatic ties with Israel. The war, known to Israelis as Yom Kippur and to Arabs as the October War, started when Egypt and Syria launched a two-front attack on Israel to regain their territories lost in the 1967 Six Day War when Israel captured the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt and Syria’s Golan Heights. Israel also seizedlarge parts of historic Palestine, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in 1967. The defeat of Arabs and Palestinians is known asthe “Naksa”, meaning setback or defeat. Egypt regained control of Sinai but Syria’s Golan Heights remains occupied by Israel. The aftermath of the war contributed to the shifting political dynamics between Arab nations and the United States. Here are some of the key events that took place in the wake of the war: The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) led by Arab countries imposed an oil embargo on the US after accusing Washington of supplying weapons to Israel in the war that ended in a stalemate. The aim was to use the oil embargo to pressure the US to resolve the Palestinian issue. They pledged to maintain this until all the territories occupied by Israel in 1967 were relinquished and the rights of Palestinians were restored. Oil prices shot up around the world, causing the US to reassess its support for the war. Even though Israel did not pull out from the occupied Palestinian territories, the embargo on the US was lifted in 1974 following peace talks. The oil crisis was a shock to economies worldwide, causing the oil price to quadruple from around $2.90 a barrel before the embargo to about $11.65 a barrel in January 1974. To avoid a future shock, the International Energy Agency (IEA) was created as a response. The Paris-based intergovernmental organization works to ensure the security of oil supplies. Former US President Jimmy Carter brokered a series of peace talks between Egypt’s then-President Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin, the former Israeli Prime Minister. These secret discussions that took place in Camp David, a country retreat for the US President near Washington, DC, spanned over 13 days. The accords laid out conditions for an Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, and a framework for Israeli-Palestinian peace using Resolution 242, which called for a withdrawal of Israel from territories occupied during the Six Day War in 1967. Israel agreed to pull out its forces and civilians from Sinai in exchange for diplomatic ties with Egypt and access to the Suez Canal after the Camp David Accords signed in 1978. While Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979, the framework never materialised. Egypt was expelled from the Arab League, and all Arab countries broke diplomatic relations with Cairo following its normalisation with Israel. Egypt was accused of disregarding the Palestinian cause, but 50 years on more Arab countries are eager to establish ties with Israel relegating the Palestinian issue to the side. Jordan followed Egypt in signing a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 while several countries, including the United Arab Emirates, recognised Israel as part of the so-called Abraham Accords in 2020.  Cairo was brought back to the Arab League in 1989. Fifty years after the Arab-Israeli war, Israel continues to occupy the Palestinian territory of West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza. The UScontinues to seethe Golan Heights as Israeli territory."

WADA warns of ‘con­se­quences’ over North Ko­re­an flag at Asian Games,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/wada-warns-of-consequences-over-north-korean-flag-at-asian-games,The North Ko­re­an flag has been rou­tine­ly hoist­ed when­ev­er their ath­letes have made the podi­um de­spite a ban.,"The World Anti-Doping Agency has warned the Olympic Council of Asia of “consequences” for allowing the North Korean flag to be repeatedly flown at the Asian Games, saying they were treating it “extremely seriously”. WADA declared North Korea’s national anti-doping body “non-compliant” in 2021 and imposed sanctions that include a ban on the country’s flag at any regional, continental or world sports event, apart from the Olympics and Paralympics. Despite the sanctions remaining in force, North Korea carried the flag at theAsian Gamesopening ceremony and it has been routinely hoisted in Hangzhou when their athletes have made the podium. OCA chief Raja Randhir Singh last week defended allowing the North Korean flag to be flown, saying the governing body of sport in Asia had written to WADA “explaining their position”. In a statement to AFP, WADA said the OCA had breached its obligations as a signatory to its anti-doping code. “WADA takes this matter extremely seriously and has written to the OCA on several occasions before and after the opening ceremony of the Games, explaining in clear terms the possible consequences that could arise for the OCA if this matter is ignored,” it said. “WADA is disappointed that the OCA has to date not taken steps to comply with the terms of the DPRK’s non-compliance,” it added, using the acronym for North Korea’s official name. “WADA will follow due process to ensure that the appropriate consequences are imposed for the OCA’s refusal to meet its signatory obligations.” There are a range of punishments WADA could impose on the Kuwait-based OCA. They include having International Olympic Committee (IOC) funding withdrawn, OCA events losing their status as qualifying events for the Olympic or Paralympic Games and the imposition of fines. The OCA declined to comment when approached by AFP.   The Montreal-based WADA sanctioned North Korea while its already tight borders were shut following the outbreak of COVID-19, which prevented international testing authorities from entering the country. North Korea recently began slowly reopening and WADA said it had started to allow them back in to collect samples. “However, the broader political status of the country means verification and quality control activities are not straightforward,” it added. “WADA will continue to work to strengthen the anti-doping system in DPRK in order to protect all athletes.” Despite its years-long isolation from the global sporting arena, North Korea has produced some eye-opening results on its return, notably in weightlifting, where its competitors have smashed six world records. Several rival lifters said they were “shocked” or “surprised” at the results. No North Korean weightlifters will participate in next year’s Paris Olympics because they failed to take part in mandatory qualifying events earlier this year. The International Weightlifting Federation said all athletes in the sport had been tested at least once at the Hangzhou Games. While the IWF does not hold jurisdiction over the Asian Games, it does have responsibility for verifying athlete whereabouts submissions under anti-doping rules. That rule required information to be provided for a minimum of three months before any competition. Two North Koreans failed to comply and were barred, the IWF said."
Philip­pines’ drag artist Pura Luka Vega ar­rest­ed for ‘of­fend­ing re­li­gion’,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/philippines-drag-artist-pura-luka-vega-arrested-for-offending-religion,Per­former faces as many as 12 years in prison af­ter their punk rock ren­di­tion of the Lord’s Prayer went vi­ral.,"A drag queen in the Philippines has been arrested after their recital of the Lord’s Prayer dressed in an outfit resembling Jesus Christ triggered outrage in the mostly Catholic country. Amadeus Fernando Pagente, who performs as Pura Luka Vega, was arrested on Wednesday in relation to their June performance during Pride in Manila of Ama Namin, a punk rock version of the Lord’s Prayer. The video later went viral and was condemned by a number of prominent religious figures as well as lawmakers. The Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines called the performance “blasphemous” and disrespectful to the church. The Philippines for Jesus Movement and some other Christian groups, meanwhile, filed a criminal complaint, and the performer was declared ‘persona non grata’ in 17 parts of the country including Manila and the southern city of Cebu. Vega, 33, was charged with breaching a law that prohibits “indecent or immoral plays, scenes, acts or shows” that “offend any race or religion”. The charges carry a jail term of up to 12 years, as well as potential fines. “Vega’s performance may offend some, but it is protected expression under international human rights law,” Ryan Thoreson, a specialist in Human Rights Watch’s Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights Program, said in a statement. “Freedom of expression includes artistic expression that offends, satirises or challenges religious beliefs.” Amid the outcry over the video in July, Vega defended themselves on X, formerly known as Twitter, saying the performance was their way of praising God. “I understand that people call my performance blasphemous, offensive or regrettable,” Vega wrote. “However, they shouldn’t tell me how I practice my faith or how I do my drag. That performance was not for you to begin with. It is my experience and my expression, of having been denied my rights.” Speaking to the AFP news agency following their detention, Vega said they had “done nothing wrong” and that their arrest highlighted “the degree of homophobia” in the Philippines. Thoreson said the charges should be dropped and Vega released. After Vega’s arrest, the hashtag #FreePuraLukaVega became the top trending topic on X in the Philippines. Nearly 80 percent of the Philippines’ population is Catholic and the country remains deeply conservative with divorce, abortion, and same-sex marriage all banned."
Trump re­vealed US nu­clear sub­ma­rine se­crets to Aus­tralia busi­ness­man: Me­dia,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/trump-revealed-us-nuclear-subs-secrets-to-australian-businessman-us-media,Trump re­port­ed to have told Aus­tralian bil­lion­aire An­tho­ny Pratt about tac­ti­cal ca­pa­bil­i­ties of US nu­clear sub­marines.,"Former United States PresidentDonald Trump shared classified informationabout US nuclear submarines with a billionaire Australian businessman shortly after he left office, in a meeting at hisFlorida private members club, Mar-a-Lago, US media have reported. The New York Times, citing two unnamed sources familiar with the matter on Thursday, identified the Australian businessman as Anthony Pratt, who heads one of the world’s largest packaging companies. ABC News, which first revealed the story, said Pratt later shared sensitive details about the US submarines with “scores of others, including more than a dozen foreign officials, several of his own employees, and a handful of journalists”. Sources told the Times that Trump’s disclosures “potentially endangered the US nuclear fleet”. Federal prosecutors already investigatingTrump for holding classified material at Mar-a-Lagoafter he left office, have interviewed Pratt twice about the incident, the New York Times reported. Pratt may now be called by prosecutors to testify against Trump in his classified documents trial, which is due to start next May in Florida.  Pratt met Trump at his Palm Beach club in April 2021, and told the ex-president he thought Australia should start buying its submarines from the US, ABC reported. In response, Trump allegedly told the businessman exact details about the capabilities of US nuclear submarines. In his conversation with the Australian, Trump revealed at least two critical pieces of information about the tactical capacities of US submarines, including “how many nuclear warheads the vessels carried and how close they could get to their Russian counterparts without being detected”, the New York Times reported.  Trump has not yet responded to the revelations, according to new reports. Aside from the classified documents case, Trump faces three other indictments: one federal and one in Georgia over his efforts to overturn his election loss and stay in power, and one in New York stemming from election-eve hush money payments in 2016 to an adult entertainment actress. Trump is currently on trial in New Yorkon charges of wildly and fraudulently inflating the value of his assets so as to get better terms from banks and insurance companies. "
Bangladesh gets first ura­ni­um ship­ment from Rus­sia for nu­clear pow­er plant,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/bangladesh-gets-first-uranium-shipment-from-russia-for-nuclear-power-plant,Rus­sia is fi­nanc­ing 90 per­cent of $12.65bn project to build Bangladesh’s first nu­clear pow­er plant in Roop­pur.,"Bangladesh has received the first Russian shipment of uranium fuel for its first nuclear power plant, making it the 33rd country in the world to produce nuclear energy. The South Asian country is building the first of two nuclear power plants in collaboration with Russian state-owned atomic company Rosatom. Ninety percent of the $12.65bn project is financed through a Russian loan repayable within 28 years with a 10-year grace period. “Today is a day of pride and joy for the people of Bangladesh,” Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said on Thursday during a video conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin that the Russian Embassy in Bangladesh called a “nuclear fuel delivery ceremony”. Speaking with Hasina via a video link, Putin thanked the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for supervising the project, which resulted from a bilateral agreement in 2011. IAEA head Rafael Grossi posted his congratulations on social media. “Bangladesh stands as a success story for newcomer countries in nuclear power development, advancing its program under the [IAEA’s] guidance,” he said.   Completion of the Rooppur plant – located around 200km (124 miles) west of the capital Dhaka – has been revised several times due to construction being delayed because of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and the sanctions on Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine. The first unit of the plant, with a total generation capacity of 2,400 megawatts, was due to start operation in July next year but that has been set back. Last month, Sergei Lavrov, the first Russian foreign minister to visit Bangladesh since its 1971 independence, assured Bangladesh that Moscow was committed to completing the project on time, despite obstacles from Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine. Russia’s state news agency TASS reported that the design and construction of the nuclear power plants is being carried out by the engineering division of Rosatom, and the plant will have a life cycle of 60 years with the possibility of extending its operations by 20 more years. Approximately 1,500 of the 2,000 workers who will run the plant once it is operational will be trained in Russia.  Bangladesh has faced its worst electricity crisis since 2013, according to the Reuters news agency, due to erratic weather and difficulty in paying for fuel imports amid declining foreign currency reserves and a weakened national currency. Electricity generation in Bangladesh is currently dependent on imported gas, which has risen sharply in price since the Russian invasion of Ukraine."
Putin says Ukraine would last ‘a week’ if West­ern mil­i­tary sup­port stops,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/putin-says-ukraine-would-last-a-week-if-western-military-support-stops,Putin’s pre­dic­tion comes as con­cerns mount about fu­ture of US fund­ing for Ukraine amid po­lit­i­cal tur­moil in Wash­ing­ton.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin said Ukraine could not survive for more than “a week” without Western military and financial aid, a claim made on the same day as a European Union official warned that the bloc could not replace the funding gap if support for Kyiv from the United States dried up. Putin made hisremarks on Western funding for Ukraineas fears mount that political turmoil in Washington could jeopardise crucial military and humanitarian aid that Kyiv requires to battle Russia’s invasion. US President Joe Biden admitted this week that he “does worry”US support for Ukraine might get derailed. Speaking on Thursday ata meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club, a Moscow-based think tank, in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Putin said that Ukraine was being propped up “thanks to multi-billion donations that come each month”. “If one just stops, it will all die in a week,” Putin said. “The same applies to the defence system. Just imagine the aid stops tomorrow. It will live for only a week when they run out of ammo,” he said. Putin also claimed that Ukraine had lost more than 90,000 troops since Kyiv’s counteroffensive against Russian forces began in June.  At a meeting of the European Political Community (EPC) in Spain on Thursday, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the EU could not replace the US as Kyiv’s primary donor. “Can Europe fill the gap left by the US? Well, certainly Europe cannot replace the US,” Borrell said. The EU and the US – together comprising most NATO members – are vital in Ukraine’s fight against Russia. The EU and its member states have promised more than $100bn in multi-year support to Ukraine, including financing weapon deliveries. Washington has committed $43bn in military assistance, while Congress has approved $113bn, which includes humanitarian aid. But new US funding for Ukraine has been put on hold as part of a weekend deal struck with opposition Republicans to avert a US government shutdown. The removal by hardline Republicans of their ownHouse of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthythis week has added to the uncertainty around aid for Ukraine. Some of the hardliners want US aid to Ukraine to cease.  Jim Dubik, a senior fellow at the Washington, DC-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank, said that Putin is counting on NATO and the US to wane in their support for Ukraine, and recent events in the US Congress play into Putin’s hands. “By cutting aid to Ukraine, Congress is directly supporting Putin’s desire to divide the alliance … Congress’s recent action does not manifest the strategic leadership the world expects of the United States,” Dubik said in a comment posted on social media.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, speaking to the meeting in Spain of European leaders on Thursday, expressed concern about Washington’s “political storms” but said he was confident he still had US bipartisan backing. Leaders at the EPC summit said Putin’s calculation was that the West would become fatigued at long-term support of Ukraine, handing him a path to victory. “I think Russia wants us to be tired,” Estonia’s Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said, adding: “We should show them that we are not. We have to help Ukraine as long as it takes.”. French President Emmanuel Macron reinforced that message in a meeting with Zelenskyy, pledging “tireless” support for Ukraine. But within the EU there are fissures. Slovakia announced it has frozen decisions on military aid to neighbouring Ukraine following parliamentary elections on Sunday which were won by former Prime Minister Robert Fico’s SMER-SSD party, which campaigned on a promise to end military support for Ukraine and sanctions on Russia.

"As vote nears, ‘hor­rif­ic racism’ mars Aus­tralian Voice ref­er­en­dum cam­paign",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/as-vote-nears-horrific-racism-mars-australian-voice-referendum-campaign,Cam­paign­ing for his­toric vote on Oc­to­ber 14 has ex­posed sharp di­vides in so­ci­ety and with­in the In­dige­nous com­mu­ni­ty.,"Melbourne, Australia– Days away from an historic referendum on Indigenous rights in Australia, the racism that has marred the campaign for weeks has intensified amid flagging public support for the proposed constitutional “Voice to Parliament”. On Thursday, a video was released on social media showing a hooded man making a series of racist remarks against Indigenous peoples, before burning an Aboriginal flag and giving a Nazi salute. The man, who was unidentified, also singled out Indigenous Independent Federal Senator Lidia Thorpe, who has been subject to a barrage of online racism and at times, death threats, since she entered the political arena in 2020. The threats have got worse in the lead-up to the referendum, scheduled forOctober 14. “People want to kill me out there. They don’t want my voice to be heard,” a visibly upset and angry Thorpe said at a press conference in response to the video. She railed against Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, accused the police of failing to protect her and challenged those who sent the video. “I’m ready to fight for exactly what I went into parliament for and that is my country, my people. And I won’t stop. And I’m not scared. So come at me.” Controversially,Thorpe– who identifies with the Djab Wurrung, Gunnai and Gunditjmara nations  – is against the Voice, a Labor Party initiative which seeks to implement a constitutionally enshrined Indigenous advisory body in the federal government. Instead, Thorpe advocates primarily for truth-telling and treaty as part of a Blak Sovereign Movement that would also demand that Indigenous deaths in custody be addressed as a priority. The lack of support for the constitutional Voice to Parliament is a stark contrast to the hugely successful 1967 referendum on Indigenous rights. At the height of the civil rights movement, 90.77 percent of Australians voted to count Indigenous people in the census and allow the federal government to make laws concerning Indigenous peoples. But this year’s vote has largely split the nation, with the latest polls suggesting 43 percent will vote ‘yes’, and 49 percent ‘no’. In Australia, areferendumasks voters to simply respond ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to a proposed constitutional amendment; a more than 50 percent ‘yes’ vote is required at a national level to make any change. Majorities are also required within each of the country’s six states. Voting is compulsory. Since theinitiativewas announced last year, public debate has been marred by misinformation and racism, from hardliners in the ‘no’ campaign as well as the Liberals, Australia’s main opposition party, and its leader Peter Dutton. The Liberal Party, who were in government until 2022, are against the proposal. In May this year, Indigenous Affairs Minister Linda Burney reprimanded Dutton in parliament for spreading “misinformation and scare campaigns” and accused Voice critics of being “hell-bent on stoking division”. Dutton’s campaign in misinformation even prompted Voice architects The Uluru Statement to include afact-checker, titled Seven Peter Dutton Lies on the Voice to Parliament Corrected, on their webpage. While Dutton has publicly condemned the Nazi video, Rueben Berg, co-chair of the First Peoples Assembly, an Indigenous advisory group in the state of Victoria, told Al Jazeera the campaign waged by the opposition leader was “emboldening the bigots and trolls”. “Since Peter Dutton announced that his party would campaign for a ‘no’ vote, we’ve seen a dramatic rise in racist abuse and hatred directed at First Peoples, both online and in everyday life,” he said. “Our Assembly Facebook page went from getting a handful of racist comments a week to our staff having to report and block hundreds of people every week.”  Berg, from the Gunditjmara nation, also said that while the First Peoples Assembly had approached Meta, which controls the Facebook platform, to amend their online community safety standards, little had been done to alleviate the racism Indigenous peoples were subjected to. “If someone at a forum got up and started hurling racist abuse at me, they’d been shown the door. But on Facebook, they can just spew horrific racism at us all day, every day,” he told Al Jazeera. “We know that the vast majority of Aboriginal people want the Voice to Parliament and want to be supporting the ‘yes’ vote, but it’s just really hard going when they get online to have a say and get screamed out by swarms of aggressive and persistent racists.” Claims of racism have been flung by opponents on both sides of the debate. Along with the “swarms of aggressive and persistent racists” online, Indigenous leaders have also entered the fracas. In late August, leading Indigenous ‘no’ campaigner Warren Mundine accused Prime Minster Albanese of instigating “horrible racial abuse” against people who do not support the Voice, leading him to “almost to suicidal positions”. Mundine was reported in Australian media saying the prime minister had “opened up the floor” for the division and abuse. Meanwhile, prominent Voice supporter and Indigenous spokesperson and academic Marcia Langton also found herself at the centre of the debate over racism after she said that claims made by the ‘no’ campaign were “based on racism and stupidity”. The heightened racial debate has led to a spike in Indigenous people seeking mental health support. Marjorie Anderson, the national manager from the Indigenous-run mental health hotline 13YARN, told Al Jazeera that the organisation had seen a 108 percent increase in callers reporting abuse, racism and trauma compared with the same period in 2022. “Overall, call numbers have also increased, with three of 13YARN’s top 10 busiest weeks having occurred over the last five weeks,” Anderson said. This latest spike in reported racism and poor mental health exacerbates an already existing concern for Indigenous peoples in Australia. Colonised by the British in1788, Indigenous peoples from more than 300 diverse nations were initially subject to genocidal massacres and forced land clearances, before punitive assimilation policies were enacted in the 20th century. Known as theStolen Generations, these policies saw Indigenous children removed from their families and cultural practices to be re-educated with British ideals, often in abusive institutions. Such policies – which only ended in the 1970s – have led to what Indigenous experts, such as the Healing Foundation, define as intergenerational trauma, leading to poor mental health outcomes exacerbated by daily experiences of racism and underscored by ongoing social inequalities. In 2022, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reported that 42 percent of Indigenous adults surveyed experienced racial discrimination on a daily basis, while more than 30 percent experienced high levels of psychological distress, more than twice the rate of non-Indigenous Australians. Such impacts on health and wellbeing also mean that suicide rates for Indigenous peoples sit well above the national average. In 2020, suicide was the fifth leading cause of death among Indigenous Australians, making up 5.5 percent of all deaths, compared with 1.9 percent for the overall Australian population. Suicide was the leading cause of death for Indigenous children aged 5-17 in that same year. The Black Dog Institute – an Australian-wide mental health support organisation which also assists Indigenous peoples – noted the parallel in mental health impacts to the 2017 plebiscite on same-sex marriage, which exacerbated homophobic abuse. The organisation says Indigenous mental health advocates had warned the government that the debate on the Voice referendum had the potential to badly affect Indigenous peoples. “We know the tonality of the debate has a significant effect on mental health impacts. The more divisive the debate, the greater the impact; the more respectful and inclusive, the lesser the impact,” said Clinton Schultz, Director of First Nations Partnership and Strategy at the organisation. Schultz, from the Gamilaroi and Gomeroi nations, added that his organisation was “already seeing firsthand the negative impacts of the debate in our communities, in terms of increased psychological distress, increased need for support and increased use of mental health services”. Earlier this year, the government set aside an additional 10 million Australian dollars ($6.37m) to fund mental health support for Indigenous peoples during the referendum campaign. The proposed Voice to Parliament is the latest initiative attempting to address the inequalities and discrimination experienced by Indigenous peoples in Australia. Despite the positive intention of the referendum itself, Australian Race Discrimination Commissioner Chin Tan said that the nature of the debate surrounding the vote had only exacerbated the problems for Indigenous people. Tan said he was “disappointed that the way some people have engaged in the debate has stoked racial tensions and caused harm to First Nations peoples.” Noting that the Voice was a “necessary measure to overcome the inequality, discrimination and structural racism experienced by First Nations people” by involving them in the decisions that affect them, he added that he was disappointed at the way campaigning had been conducted. “I’m concerned that the racism that has occurred has been largely unchallenged in the public sphere,” he told Al Jazeera. “Racism should never be accepted as part of the exchange of ideas in public debate. More than ever, this demonstrates we have a lot to learn as a community about the nature of racism and the harms it causes.” Police are now investigating the Nazi video, while Albanese has condemned the statements and actions of the perpetrator. “I’ve seen the video that is referred to that is threatening towards Senator Thorpe and towards the government,” he said. “The sort of Nazi rhetoric and comments that are in that video have no place in discourse in Australian political life.” After the video was released, Lidia Thorpe went to stay with family member Ringo Terrick, while police officers kept watch outside the house. Terrick, from the Wurundjeri Woiwurrung nation, attended Thursday’s press conference with Thorpe. He told Al Jazeera that while the politician was “a very strong woman”, she was “in a state of fear from the extremist threats to cause her harm in the midst of this referendum conversation that’s going on in the country.” “The referendum has caused a great deal of angst and anxiety for lots of [Indigenous] people,” he said."

Putin sug­gests Wag­n­er boss Prigozhin’s plane brought down by grenade blast,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/putin-suggests-wagner-mercenary-chiefs-plane-brought-down-by-grenade-blast,Russ­ian leader says grenade frag­ments found in bod­ies of those killed in crash in which Wag­n­er’s Yevge­ny Prigozhin died.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested that the plane crash whichkilled the head of the Wagner mercenary force, Yevgeny Prigozhin, was caused by the detonation of hand grenades inside the aircraft. Putin suggested on Thursday thatPrigozhin’s plane was blown upfrom the inside, not hit by a missile as rumoured, saying that the head of Russia’s investigative committee had reported that traces of explosives were discovered in the bodies of those who died in the crash in August. “Fragments of hand grenades were found in the bodies of those killed in the crash,” Putin told a meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. “There was no external impact on the plane – this is already an established fact,” Putin said, appearing to rubbish claims by United States officials who believed the plane was shot down. The private Embraer jet on whichPrigozhin was travelling to Saint Petersburgcrashed north of Moscow killing all 10 people on board on August 23. Two other top Wagner figures, Prigozhin’s four bodyguards and a crew of three were also killed. Putin did not give any more details about how a grenade or grenades could have been detonated on board the executive jet, but said he thought investigators were wrong not to have carried out alcohol and drug tests on the bodies of those who died in the crash. “In my opinion, such an examination should have been carried out, but it was not,” Putin said.  Putin also claimed that searches of Wagner’s offices in St Petersburg after the crash turned up 10 billion roubles ($100m) in cash and 5kg (11 pounds) of cocaine. The investigators of the crash have yet to report publicly on their findings. Moscow rejected an offer from Brazil, where the Embraer business jet was built, to join the crash inquiry. The Washington, DC-basedInstitute for the Study of War (ISW), a think tank monitoring the conflict in Ukraine, described Putin’s explanation for the crash as “bizarre” and intended to “deflect blame from the Kremlin”. The ISW said that Putin appeared to be sketching a scenario involving alcohol, drugs and the mishandling of explosives by people on board the plane in an attempt to blame the victims for their own deaths. The Russian president “implied that the plane crash victims may have been using alcohol or drugs onboard that could have led to the negligent handling of grenades (that were presumably on board for some unexplained reason)”, the think tank said. “Putin’s bizarre explanation of the plane crash is likely an attempt to blame Prigozhin for his own and his comrades’ deaths and further disgrace him among his remaining supporters,” the ISW added.  Prigozhin died in the crashexactly two months to the day after leading a short-lived mutinyagainst Russia’s defence establishment and presented the biggest challenge to Putin’s rule since he came to power in 1999. A preliminary US intelligence assessment concluded that an intentional explosion caused the crash, and Western officials have pointed to a long list of Putin foes who have been assassinated. The Kremlin has rejected as an “absolute lie” the suggestion that Putin had Prigozhin killed in revenge for the rebellion by the Wagner private army. The fate of Wagner has been unclear since Prigozhin’s death.  Putin has ordered Wagner fighters to sign contracts with Russia’s defence ministry, a move which Prigozhin and many of his men had opposed. When asked about the future of so-called private military companies in Russia, Putin said on Thursday that as there had been no law on such groups, the experience of them in Russia had been “clumsy”. “We do not yet have a consensus in Russia about whether we need such formations or not, but today I can say for sure that several thousand fighters of this company have already signed contracts with the armed forces,” Putin said. Before his death,Prigozhin had accused Russia’s military leaders,  particularly Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov, of incompetence and warned that Russia could lose the war in Ukraine unless it raised its game. After his death, Putin described the Wagner chief as a man who had made “serious mistakes in his life but he achieved the right results”. The Wagner Group mercenary force that Prigozhin created was active in Ukraine, Syria, Libya and several African countries and counted tens of thousands of fighters at its peak.  Sanctioned by the European Union and the US for gross human rights abuses in the countries where Wagner deployed, the force played a key role in the fighting in Ukraine, where it spearheaded the capture of the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut in May after months of bloody combat."
‘Dys­func­tion­al’: Speak­er de­ba­cle plunges US pol­i­tics into un­cer­tain­ty,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/5/dysfunctional-speaker-debacle-plunges-us-politics-into-uncertainty,"As Re­pub­li­cans de­lib­er­ate to choose a new leader to suc­ceed Mc­Carthy, ex­perts say next speak­er will not have it easy.","Washington, DC –The next speaker of the United States House of Representatives will face a gruelling task: maintaining near unanimous support among a divided Republican caucus while reaching agreements with Democrats to fund the government. Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy found out the hard way that the two jobs can be at odds with one another. When hestruck a dealwith Democrats to temporarily fund the government on Saturday, he sparked a Republican backlash that culminated in his removal from the speakership position. The Republicans have a thin majority in the House, so the same small faction of conservatives — led byCongressman Matt Gaetz— that toppled McCarthy can also remove his eventual successor. That has instilled an atmosphere of uncertainty moving forward. “There’s a fear that they will just continue to do this to any speaker. And obviously, that creates a really chaotic environment where the House can’t consider bills,” said Rachel Blum, a professor of political science at the University of Oklahoma. With that threat hanging over the next speaker, experts say the House and the US government more broadly are facing the possibility of chronic dysfunction in the months ahead. McCarthy, a California conservative, was removed in a 216-210 vote on Tuesday, with the entire Democratic caucus joining eight Republicans to remove him. Now, House Republicans are privately deliberating to choose the next speaker, with Patrick McHenry serving as the acting leader of the chamber. Jim Jordan, the chair of the House Judiciary Committee and former head of the right-wing Freedom Caucus, has announced his candidacyfor the role. So has Steve Scalise, the House majority leader. Whoever wins will need to appease Gaetz and his fellow disruptors in the Republican caucus while running a functioning chamber.  The government is divided: Democrats control the Senate and the White House, while Republicans are in charge of the House. Given that split, Congress is not expected to advance major legislation. But the legislative branch — composed of both the House and the Senate — must pass a budget to fund the government. The recently approved stopgap funding bill that cost McCarthy his gavel will expire on November 17. If lawmakers fail to approve further funding, the governmentwill shut down, which would bring some agencies to a halt and cause disruptions in the pay of federal workers. Another compromise to secure agovernment budgetwill be more difficult this time around, experts say. “I can’t see the next Republican speaker stepping into that role and taking from this McCarthy episode the lesson that he should continue to compromise,” Blum told Al Jazeera. “It seems that any speaker is going to have to put up a little bit more of a fight in order to maintain the speakership.” Another issue at stake is Ukraine aid — a top priority for President Joe Biden’s administration. Many right-wing Republicans are sceptical of providing more assistance and would likely use their leverage over the speaker to disrupt it. The White House is seeking billions in additional aid to Kyiv. According to the Congressional Research Service, the US legislature has appropriated more than$113bnfor Ukraine since the Russian invasion of the country began last year. It is not clear when those funds will run out. With so much in the balance, some observers are questioning why the Democrats did not bail out McCarthy in his hour of need. While Gaetz is largely credited with toppling McCarthy, the overwhelming majority of the votes against him came from Democrats. Every single Democrat present for the vote backed Gaetz’smotion to vacatethe speaker’s chair. A handful of Democratic votes would have allowed McCarthy to keep the speaker’s gavel. Adam Cayton, a political science professor at the University of West Florida, said that if the Democrats had voted to save McCarthy, the move would have been unprecedented. Cayton explained that while McCarthy’s removal is a first in US history, having a minority-backed speaker would “also be really out of the ordinary”. He stressed that the House operates on majority rule. “It also would have been unprecedented for the minority party to support a speaker of the other party, to let him stay in office in spite of not having the support of a majority of the chamber,” Cayton told Al Jazeera. McCarthy had angered Democrats from the start of his tenure as speaker in January. Early on, he removed three Democratic lawmakers from their committees, including booting RepresentativeIlhan Omarfrom the foreign affairs panel. And last month, he openedan impeachment inquiryagainst Biden over his son Hunter’s business dealings, which the White House described as “extreme politics at its worst”. Moreover, McCarthy ruled out negotiating with the Democrats to get their votes this week. “They haven’t asked for anything. I’m not going to provide anything,” he told CNBC earlier this week. In a statement before the vote, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries squarely blamed Republicans for the impasse, accusing them of empowering “right-wing extremists” and urging them to resolve their “civil war”. Jeffries also explicitly invoked the impeachment push. “Rather than work with us to solve problems for everyday Americans, extremism continues to run rampant in the House of Representatives,” he said.  But Jennifer Nicoll Victor, a political science professor at George Mason University in Virginia, faulted the Democrats for siding against McCarthy. She felt the move was unwarranted, particularly if their motive was to rebuke McCarthy’s antagonising conduct. “If in fact, it was a sort of a petty, emotional or reactionary kind of response that, to me, seems anti-democratic, against good governance, against the best practices of how democracies are supposed to work,” Victor said. “Political parties are supposed to respect their political opponents’ rights to power in a democracy,” she explained. “Being spiteful about helping some extreme faction depose your political opponents — I think goes against the norms of democracy.” Despite the grim outlook, a deadlock in the House is not inevitable. There are several scenarios where the chamber can do its job despite the political realities spelled out byMcCarthy’s removal. Republican moderates and Democrats could form a bipartisan majority to pass legislation, but analysts say that would be unlikely given the political polarisation in the country. It is also not a foregone conclusion that Gaetz and his allies will have it out for the next speaker the way they had McCarthy in their crosshairs. University of Oklahoma’s Blum said Gaetz and his fellow rebels may back down after achieving the visibility and power they desire. “One path forward is that the speaker can at least unite the Republican caucus, so they can agree and get things done,” she told Al Jazeera. “Or they could end up with another speaker who has to govern with support from Democrats.”  But for Victor, the likeliest outcome is that dysfunction will prevail, with the Gaetz faction feeling emboldened. Moderates may even rebel against a future far-right speaker. “We’ll probably just hobble through that way — whether that means they can’t get the spending done and we have another shutdown, or ifthe debt ceilingbecomes another issue at some point, or no new legislation gets done because they can’t get their act together,” she said. “It seems like a dysfunctional situation.” The only silver lining, she added, is that this Congress’s term will expire in a little more than a year. “So there is an endpoint.”"

In a meeting of European leaders in the Spanish city of Granada on Thursday, European Council President Charles Michel said he invited Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev to meet in Brussels this month. “We believe in diplomacy. We believe in political dialogue,” Michel told reporters at the summit of the European Political Community, a forum including more than 40 countries.  Aliyevdeclined to attendthe summit in Granada, where European leaders had hoped that Armenia and Azerbaijan could work to resolve tensions and reach an agreement over Nagorno-Karabakh. At the summit, leaders also pledged support for Armenia as it grapples with the fallout of the Azerbaijani military operation last month to seize control of the enclave, mainly populated by ethnic Armenians. Many EU leaders have condemned the Azerbaijani operation and some governments have called for the bloc to consider tough measures against Baku, which has insisted it took legitimate action to regain control of a part of its sovereign territory. Tens of thousands ofethnic Armenianresidents have fled Nagorno-Karabakh to neighbouring Armenia since Armenian separatists wereforced into a ceasefireon September 20 after a 24-hour military operation by the much larger Azerbaijani military. The European Parliament passed a resolution on Thursday accusing Baku of “ethnic cleansing”.  Many European leaders haveexpressed concernover the humanitarian situation in Nagorno-Karabakh, and Michel, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz declared their “unwavering support” for Armenia’s territorial integrity on Thursday after meeting with Pashinyan. However, there does not appear to be consensus among European leaders over potential sanctions for Azerbaijan, animportant sourceof oil and natural gas for the EU and an ally of the United States. France’s Macron said that while Azerbaijan seemed to have “a problem with international law”, steps such as sanctions would not be productive. Leaders at the summit agreed to step up aid to Armenia, with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen saying that the EU will provide $5.53m in emergency aid on top of a similar amount previously announced."
Putin hints Rus­sia could re­turn to nu­clear test­ing,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/5/putin-hints-russia-could-return-to-nuclear-testing,The Russ­ian pres­i­dent says Moscow could ‘the­o­ret­i­cal­ly’ with­draw from land­mark nu­clear test ban treaty.,"Russian PresidentVladimir Putinhas suggested that Russia could return to nuclear weapons testing and might withdraw its ratification of a landmark nuclear test ban treaty. In an address on Thursday that touched on topics such as nuclear weapons, energy, and the war in Ukraine, Putin also said that Russia had tested a new nuclear-powered missile delivery system but had not decided whether to resume thetesting of explosives. “I think no person of sound mind and clear memory would think of using nuclear weapons against Russia,” Putin said in the speech at a forum of foreign policy experts in Sochi. “I hear calls to start testing nuclear weapons, to return to testing,” he added. “I am not ready to say whether we really need to conduct tests or not.” He announced that Russia has effectively completed the development of the Burevestnik cruise missile and the Sarmat heavy intercontinental ballistic missile and will work on putting them into production. “We conducted the last successful test of the Burevestnik nuclear-powered global-range cruise missile,” he said. His statement was the first announcement of a successful test of the Burevestnik, which translates as “Storm Petrel.” It was first mentioned by Putin in 2018. Little is known about the Burevestnik, which was code-named Skyfall by NATO, and many Western experts have been sceptical about it, noting that a nuclear engine could be highly unreliable. It is believed to be able to carry a nuclear warhead or a conventional one, and potentially could stay aloft for a much longer time than other missiles and cover much more distance, due to nuclear propulsion.  Putin’s speech is the latest in which the Russian leader underscored the country’snuclear capabilities, as relations between Russia and Western powers remain tense over Russia’s war in Ukraine. Putin said that it was “theoretically” possible for Russia to withdraw from the nuclear test ban treaty, which generally prohibits the testing ofnuclear weapons, but that no decision has been made. He also noted that the United States has not signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, stating that Russia, which ratified the agreement in 2000, may follow in its steps. In the wide-ranging speech, the Russian president said that the West was trying to create “a new Iron Curtain” and laid responsibility for the Russian invasion of Ukraine at the feet of Western powers. “The war, which was started by the Kyiv regime with active support from the West, has been going on already for 10 years,” he said. “The special military operation was launched to stop it.” Russia launched its full-scale invasion ofUkrainein February 2022. Since then,thousands of civilianshave been killed and millions of others have fled the country, according to the United Nations. Tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed or wounded on each side and large swathes of eastern and southern Ukraine have been devastated in the fighting. Earlier on Thursday, Ukrainian officials reported that a Russianmissile strikehad slammed into a grocery store and cafe near the city of Kharkiv, killing at least 51 people. In his speech, Putin also said that Russia was attempting to create a “new world” in defiance of Western “hegemony”, praising the rising influence of Eastern countries such as India and China. He also reiterated Russia’s opposition to Ukraine’s accession to NATO, which he deemed a tool of US foreign policy, but said that he has no objections to Ukraine joining the European Union."
‘Noth­ing changes’: Ar­gen­tine vot­ers ex­press ex­as­per­a­tion ahead of elec­tions,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/5/nothing-changes-argentine-voters-express-exasperation-ahead-of-elections,"In the wake of Ar­genti­na’s first 2023 pres­i­den­tial de­bate, vot­ers weigh in on the econ­o­my, abor­tion and Javier Milei.","Buenos Aires, Argentina –It was a “superclásico” kind of Sunday last weekend in Argentina, with more than one kind of high-profile match-up capturing the public’s attention. On the same day that rival football teams Boca Juniors and River Plate faced off on the pitch, five political giants likewise collided in the first of two televised debates ahead of Argentina’s presidential elections. The first round of voting is scheduled for October 22. Much of the focus on Sunday was on one candidate in particular:Javier Milei, 52, a far-right libertarian economist who netted the most votes inAugust’s primaries, delivering a stunning rebuke to the political establishment. With nearly 30 percent of the primary vote, he prevailed over Patricia Bullrich, the candidate for the centre-right coalition, and Sergio Massa, the economy minister representing the ruling centre-left coalition. Withannual inflationskyrocketing to 124 percent and the value of the local currency dropping every week, experts say Milei’s lead shows adesire for something differentamong the Argentine electorate. Milei has positioned himself as the outsider who canoverhaul the system— and has subsequently become the candidate to beat. His promises to ditch the Argentine peso in favour of the United States dollar and scrap the country’s central bank have fuelled hispopularity. Public opinion polls continue to show him in first place. But his controversial platform and public persona could spark a backlash. In recent months, Milei has garnered criticism for bashingPope Francisas a “disgusting leftist”, pushing to privatise public education and downplaying thehorrorsthat occurred underArgentina’s military dictatorship, from 1976 to 1983. Al Jazeera caught up with voters after the debate to talk about the issues that mattered most to them — and which candidates caught their eye. [Explaining her opposition to Milei and his criticism of abortion rights and sex education.] “I wouldn’t vote for any politician who wants to put our rights at risk, who wants to take away a lot of the things that we have won. “I feel it like a threat because something very important is in jeopardy: the right to an abortion, the rights of communities, the right to sex ed. “I think there are a lot of parties that are taking a lot of liberties and spreading misinformation, which ends up drawing out a lot of people. “But there are a lot of things that they actually can’t do. So even if the intention is there or the intention isn’t a bad one, there are realities that just don’t make it possible. For example, like dollarisation [the process of using the US dollar as national currency]… “So we end up talking about things that can’t end up happening.” “The most important thing that the government has to do is bring in more security, because it’s impossible to move around the province of Buenos Aires or the capital city. There needs to be more law enforcement. And all the people who are living on the street: There is so much poverty. They sleep outside and eat from the garbage bins. “And then there’s the poor pensioners who have worked their whole lives and are earning a pittance. “I keep working because I have to keep working.” “I’m voting for Milei. He’s the only one who is different. As long as I’ve been alive, we’re always in the same situation, and nothing changes. We have to go for something different. “[I’m worried about] inflation. Every day, my salary is worth less. It’s not enough for anything. I used to work in construction, almost as a full-time employee, but it wasn’t enough. The price of things would go up, but my salary wouldn’t. So I had to start running deliveries. I have to kill myself working a bit more, but at least I earn enough.” [Explaining what he likes about Milei’s economic agenda.] “Less subsidies, less ministries, less public spending.” “There’s like this feeling of resignation — mine and also people in general. “It’s like, no matter who wins, we’re in this situation. There isn’t any faith that any of the candidates can actually get the country out of this. It’s like: I don’t want the guy [representing the party] that already won to win again, and this other guy [Milei] scares me. “So I pick Bullrich, who at least scares me the least, but it’s not like I actually have hope that anything will change. At least, not in the near future.” “I am going to vote, without a doubt, for Massa because he brings together a whole trajectory of an entire process of historical reconstruction that we have been going through in these 40 years of democracy. “And especially, facing the abyss that we find ourselves in, I think that he is the one who is challenging us to keep rebuilding ourselves with hope and, above all, the processes of memory, truth and justice anchored in the perspective of human rights.”"

Iran au­thor­i­ties deny ar­rest­ing moth­er of hos­pi­talised teenag­er,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/5/iran-authorities-deny-arresting-mother-of-armita-geravand,Rights group says se­cu­ri­ty forces ar­rest the moth­er of a teenag­er in a coma af­ter an al­leged con­fronta­tion with po­lice.,"Iran’s judiciary has denied a report by a rights group that said security forces had arrested the mother of a teenage girl who was in a coma after an alleged confrontation with police. Iranian authorities have denied reports by rights activists that the 16-year-old girl, Armita Geravand, was injured on Sunday in a confrontation with officers enforcing the country’s conservative dress code, which requires women to wear a head covering. The Iranian-Kurdish rights group Hengaw said that security forces arrested Geravand’s mother Shahin Ahmadi on Thursday near the hospital where her daughter was taken after the incident. Iran’s judiciary denied the report by Hengaw on the X social media platform. Iranian state news agency IRNA reported that the judiciary denied any arrest having taken place. It said that unidentified enemies were spreading rumours about Geravand’s “loss of consciousness” for their own gain. The incident has come more thana year afterMahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman whosedeath in a comain September 2022 in the custody of morality police sparked weeks of nationwide anti-government protests, which led to a violent crackdown by authorities.  A new hijab law has taken effect in Iran which imposes punishments on women who do not wear it in public. UN-appointed rights officials last month expressed their concern about the law. Two rights activists said Geravand fell into a coma following what they said was a confrontation with agents in the Tehran metro for violating the hijab law, the Reuters news agency reported. The Tehran Metro Operating Company told state news agency IRNA that CCTV footage showed no sign of verbal or physical conflict between passengers or company employees. The hospitalisation of Geravand has ignited anger on social media among Iranians who demand full video footage of what happened, including from inside a metro car. “We have YET another beautiful girl in a coma all for the crime of bad hijab … her name is Armita Geravand. She is only 16,” human rights lawyer Gissou Nia, who serves as board chair of the Iran Human Rights Documentation Center, wrote on X.  CCTV footage shared by IRNA showed Geravand without a hijab accompanied by two female friends walking towards a train from a platform. Upon entering the carriage, one of the girls is seen immediately backing off and reaching for the ground, before another girl is dragged unconscious from the train by passengers. Geravand’s mother and father appeared in a video posted on IRNA on Wednesday saying that their daughter had suffered a drop in blood pressure, lost her balance, and hit her head on the metro train. Rights groups said the statement was made under duress. Iran’s government has imposed restrictions on women’s dress since a popular revolution deposed the secular and Western-backed Shah in 1979. Women are obliged to cover their hair and wear long, loose-fitting clothes. Violators have faced public rebuke, fines or arrest yet in the months following last year’s unrest women were still widely seen unveiled in malls, restaurants, shops and streets around the country.  The incident has drawn international attention. Germany’s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock had said on X, “Once again a young woman in #Iran is fighting for her life. Just because she showed her hair in the subway.” US Deputy Special Envoy for Iran Abram Paley also wrote that he was “shocked and concerned about reports that Iran’s so-called morality police have assaulted 16-year-old Armita Geravand”. Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nasser Kanaani criticised the United States, United Kingdom and Germany for remarks they made about women’s rights in Iran and Geravand’s case. “Instead of interventionist and biased remarks and expressing insincere concern over Iranian women and girls, you’d better be concerned about U.S., German and UK healthcare personnel, patients and tackle their situation,” he wrote on X."
‘Where’s the crowd?’: Fans de­ride emp­ty sta­di­um at World Cup open­ing match,https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2023/10/5/where-is-the-crowd-fans-deride-empty-stadium-at-world-cup-opening-match,Crick­et fans slam or­gan­is­ers as the ICC Crick­et World Cup gets un­der­way amidst thou­sands of emp­ty seats in Ahmed­abad.,"It was billed as the most anticipated cricket event of the year, held in the sport’s biggest stadium globally, in a country that is known to worship the game. But when the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 finally got under way in India on Thursday, only a few thousand seats were occupied in a stadium that was revamped for the tournament in order to house at least 120,000 spectators. As England and New Zealandsquared offat Ahmedabad’s Narendra Modi Stadium, which was renamed after the Indian prime minister in 2021, cricket fans took to social media to express their shock at the rows of empty saffron-coloured seats glaring back at them. England women’s cricketer Danni Wyatt asked “Where’s the crowd?” in a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. Jemimah Rodrigues, her Indian counterpart, responded by saying the crowd is waiting for India’s match against Pakistan on Saturday, October 14.  Fans have been critical of the tournament’s scheduling and ticketing process. The first batch of tickets went on sale on August 25, less than six weeks before the opening match, making it difficult for travelling fans to put plans into place. Indian cricket fans, who had been waiting for years to watch the sport’s biggest event in their backyard,told Al Jazeerathey had given up on their dream of supporting their team at home. One well-travelled sports fan, Vipul Yadav, described the management of the ticketing process as “nonsensical”. “Nowhere in the world, do you have to struggle so much for a ticket. All this has happened because the ticket release has been done too late,” he said.  During the first few innings of the England vs New Zealand match, a few hundred fans from both participating countries could be seen in the stands. Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Jay Shah took it upon himself to fill up at least one more seat when he was shown seated in the stands amidst some cheering and confused-looking fans in the middle of England’s innings. As the match went on, local fans began filling up some seats, but the attendance was nowhere close to being at even half capacity. Former India captain Ravi Shastri pointed out during the match commentary that India’s absence in the opening match could be a big factor behind the apparent indifference from local fans. Indeed, it is the first time in 27 years that the opening match of the tournament has not involved a host nation. Ironically, the last time it happened it was also during a World Cup hosted by India, with the same teams facing each other at the same venue – albeit then known as the Motera Stadium.  Before the start of the match, Indian cricket great Sachin Tendulkar walked on to the ground with the tournament winners’ trophy and waved cheerfully to the few spectators. Later, Tendulkar attempted to painstakingly explain the local fans’ love for international cricketers and promised they would “make it a special event for all players”. But online, the criticism continued. Manya, a cricket fan and writer from India, said building the world’s biggest stadium is not akin to being the world’s sports administrators.  In another first, the tournament was officially declared open not by a head of state in a colourful opening ceremony ahead of the first match, but through a captains’ news conference held a day earlier. “Captains’ Day kicks off ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023 in style,” the ICC said in a statement a day ahead of the opening match.  Fans drew comparisons with the last time the tournament was hosted in the subcontinent, in 2011, and the opening ceremony included performances by some of the region’s biggest music stars.  The tournament moves to the south Indian city of Hyderabad on Friday, when India’s neighbour Pakistan will take on the Netherlands in their first match. Pakistan’s contingent was given a rapturous welcome by the local crowd when they landed in India last week. Prior to setting off for India, Pakistan captain Babar Azam said he expected Indian fans to support Pakistan despite decades of tense ties between the two countries. “Most of our matches are sold out, which means Indian fans are eager to see us and support us in the stadiums,” Azam told reporters. India’s bitter rivals may see bigger crowds in the 39,000-capacity Rajiv Gandhi Stadium in Hyderabad. "
Fam­i­lies of jailed Tunisian op­po­si­tion ask ICC to in­ves­ti­gate pres­i­dent,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/5/families-of-jailed-tunisian-opposition-ask-icc-to-investigate-president,Rel­a­tives go to The Hague to pres­sure the court to go af­ter lead­ers in Tu­nis over al­leged rights abus­es.,"The children of four jailed Tunisian opposition figures have called on the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate claims of political persecution and the deteriorating human rights situation in the North African country. At a press conference in The Hague on Thursday, Netherlands, the families’ lawyer said they have filed a complaint at the ICC calling on its prosecutor to investigate the country’s leaders. Present were the sons and daughters of opposition Ennahdha party head Rached Ghannouchi, lawyer and prominent government critic Ghazi Chaouachi, writer and activist Chaima Issa and Ennahdha politician Said Ferjani. “We have had to make this filing because it is the government itself that is carrying out these crimes,” lawyer Rodney Dixon said, adding that the actionsamount to “crimes against humanity”. Since President Kais Saied came to power at the end of 2019, his rule has become increasingly oppressive. In July 2021, hesuspended the parliament, in which Ennahdha had a plurality; fired the prime minister, Hichem Mechichi; and began ruling by decree – moves that were condemned and branded a coup by the opposition. He alsodissolvedthe judicial council, which guarantees the independence of judges. Since then, there have been several rounds of arrests that have resulted in the detention of several senior opposition politicians, former ministers, scholars, business figuresand activists. Protests against the detentions, Saied’s one-man rule and lack of progress on improving the economy have been held regularly, and security forces have respondedviolently. On Wednesday, 60 activists went on a one-day hunger strike to protest “arbitrary arrests and unfair trials” of the president’s opponents. On Friday, Ghannouchi, 84,began a three-day hunger striketo protest his detention and show support for other “political prisoners”. A court sentenced Ghannouchi, a former speaker of parliament, to one year in prison on “terrorism” charges in May, a charge his party says is politically motivated. He was arrested in April. “My father went on hunger strike to protest his unjust detention and that of other detainees, both political detainees and activists,” Yusra Ghannouchi told Al Jazeera, from The Hague. “He is calling for the restoration of democracy and the rule of law in our country. “He went on a hunger strike because he had no other option. Saied has dismantled all independent bodies and institutions in the country.” “In the last two years, all he [Saied] has been doing is bringing back dictatorship to Tunisia,” the former spokesperson of Ennahdha added. “He has no solution to the problems facing the country like the economy, which has gotten worse since he grabbed power. There are no checks and balances left in the country. That is why many politicians and activists are going on strike.” Analysts say the filing of the ICC complaint may not make a difference to Saied. “I don’t think it will make any difference to him. He’s not sensitive to pressure. The regime will be worried about the impact of what this is going to do. It is a problem, which they would have preferred not to have,” analyst Hatem Nafti told Al Jazeera. “It will have a moral impact. Those who support him will now take notice of his actions. They will start doubting him even more. This is definitely not good for his image or what is left of it,” he added. On Tuesday,Abir Moussi, the head of the Free Destourian (Constitutional) Party and an outspoken critic of Saied, was arrested. Moussi was detained outside the presidential palace, where she went to file a challenge against a recent presidential decree on holding local elections this year, her party said. Criticism in coming not only from within Tunisia. The international human rights group Amnesty InternationalaccusedSaied of stifling political opposition and taking steps that repress free expression. “Decree by decree, blow by blow, President Saied and his government have dramatically undermined respect for human rights in Tunisia,” Heba Morayef, Amnesty’s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement. “He has stripped away basic freedoms that Tunisians fought hard to earn and fostered a climate of repression and impunity. The Tunisian authorities must immediately reverse this treacherous trajectory and uphold their international human rights obligations,” she added. In recent years, Tunisia’s status as the only democratic success story stemming from the Arab Spring uprisings has been tarnished. The country of 12 million people has also been grappling with economic turmoil and ahigh unemploymentrate as well as severe water shortages. Dire economic pressure and political oppression have pushed many Tunisians toflee the country, hoping to save themselves and their families. They are not the only ones. Tunisia’s proximity to the Italian island of Lampedusa in the Mediterranean Sea has made it a departure point for many Africans and Arabs fleeing similarly hopeless situations in their own countries. As asylum seekerswait for a chance to leaveTunisia on rickety boats that have killed more than 2,500 people alone this year, according to the United Nations, they have found themselves at the receiving end of racist diatribes from Saied, who accused them of beingpart of a conspiracyto destroy Tunisia’s “Arab character”."
Ukraine says dozens of peo­ple killed in Russ­ian at­tack on Kharkiv vil­lage,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/5/dozens-killed-attack-on-kharkiv-village,"Of­fi­cials say a boy, age six, among those killed in at­tack on Hroza vil­lage, where res­i­dents were at­tend­ing a wake.","At least 51 people have been killed and six wounded in a Russian missile attack on a northeastern village, Ukrainian officials say. Oleh Syniehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, said the afternoon strike on Thursday hit a cafe and a store in the village of Hroza, about 30km (20 miles) west of the front-line town of Kupiansk, with many civilians present at the time of the attack. He added that a six-year-old child was among the dead. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said residents of the village of about 330 people had been holding a memorial service in the cafe that was struck. “From every family, from every household, there were people present at this commemoration. This is a terrible tragedy,” Klymenko told Ukrainian television. There was no immediate comment by Russia, which in the past has denied hitting civilian targets. The attack was the deadliest in the Kharkiv region since Russia’s invasion began more than 19 months ago, a regional official told public broadcaster Suspilne. It appeared to be one of the biggest civilian death tolls in any single Russian strike. Footage released by Ukrainian authorities showed rescue workers sifting through piles of rubble and bodies coated in dust laid out next to the site of the attack. Klymenko cited preliminary information that he said showed the attack was carried out with an Iskander ballistic missile. “The terrorists deliberately carried out the attack during lunchtime to ensure a maximum number of casualties,” Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said. “There were no military targets there. This is a heinous crime intended to scare Ukrainians.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was attending asummitwith European leaders in Spain, said: “Russian terror should be stopped.”  Zelenskyy called on Western countries to redouble their support for Ukraine’s war effort and air defence systems. A spokesman for the head of the United Nations said he “strongly condemns” the attack. “Attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law, and they must stop immediately,” Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said in a statement. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in a message posted by his office on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that he was “shocked and saddened” by the attack. “Our human rights monitors will visit the site to gather information. Accountability is key,” he said. Maria Adeeva, the research director at the European Expert Association in Ukraine, said the Hroza attack was “clearly deliberate”. “Russians knew that all those people were there, and they precisely attacked this building,” Adeeva told Al Jazeera. “This strike was so huge that from what we know now, only 30 bodies are being able to be identified from 51 people killed so that means that 20 bodies still aren’t identified,” she said."

It was the longest vote for speaker of the House since the US Civil War and it was fraught with political divisions. Nine months later, McCarthy’s tenuous leadership came crashing down this week, as he became the first speaker of the House to be voted out. The move was led by members of his own party.

At least 100 killed as Syr­i­an mil­i­tary col­lege hit in drone at­tack,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/5/syrian-military-college-hit-in-drone-attack,At least 100 peo­ple killed and 240 oth­ers wound­ed in drone at­tack on mil­i­tary col­lege in Homs.,"A drone attack on a military college in Syria’s Homs province during a graduation ceremony has killed at least 100 people and wounded 240 more, a war monitor and the Syrian health minister have said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said more than 100 people were killed and 125 injured. An official in the alliance backing Syria’s government said the toll was about 100. Health Minister Hassan Al-Ghabash gave a lower figure, telling state television 80 people had been killed, including six children, but that about 240 people had been injured. There were concerns the death toll could rise further as many of the wounded were in serious condition. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. Syria’s military earlier said drones laden with explosives targeted the ceremony on Thursday as it came to an end. In a statement, the military accused fighters “backed by known international forces” for the attack. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “expressed deep concern” at the drone attack in Homs as well as “reports of retaliatory shelling” in northwest Syria, his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. Syria’s defence minister attended the graduation ceremony but left minutes before the attack, the Reuters news agency reported, citing a Syrian security source and a source in the regional alliance backing the Damascus government against opposition groups. “After the ceremony, people went down to the courtyard and the explosives hit. We don’t know where it came from, and corpses littered the ground,” said a Syrian man who had helped set up decorations at the ceremony. Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, who has reported extensively on Syria, said that that attack represents “a major security breach, a blow to the Syrian regime”. “It has been years since the forces of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have been targeted in such an operation in the heart of government-controlled territory,” she said. “It seems that the Syrian regime is blaming the opposition because just moments after this attack, their planes started to target residential areas in the opposition-controlled enclaves in the northwest of the country.” At least six people were killed, including a woman and child, and 40 others wounded in the attacks on the northwestern province of Idlib, according to a Syrian volunteer emergency rescue group. The attacks targeted 20 villages and towns across Idlib governorate, according to the Syrian Civil Defence, also known as the White Helmets. At least eight children and eight women were among the wounded. The attacks, launched from government positions south and east of Jabal al-Zawiya, began at 3:30pm local time (12:30 GMT). Locals say the attacks targeted a power station and a popular market. Meanwhile, in northeast Syria, the United States said it had shot down an armed Turkish drone that was operating near its troops on Thursday, despite denials from a Turkish defence ministry official. If the drone was Turkish, it would be the first time that Washington has brought down an aircraft belonging to its NATO ally. The Turkish official, speaking to Reuters, did not specify whose property the drone was. Turkey’s National Intelligence Agency carried out strikes in Syria against targets believed to be linked to a bomb attack in Ankara last weekend, a Turkish security source said on Thursday. Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder said Turkish drones had been seen carrying out airstrikes on Hasakah on Thursday morning about 1km (0.6 miles) away from US troops. A few hours later, a Turkish drone came within less than half a kilometre (0.3 miles) of US troops and was deemed a threat and shot down by F-16 aircraft. “We have no indication that Turkey was intentionally targeting US forces,” Ryder told reporters. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Turkish counterpart after the incident, a call Ryder said was “fruitful”. US-allied Kurdish-led Syrian forces said Turkish attacks had killed eight people in an escalation prompted by the bomb attack in Ankara by the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). US support for the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in northern Syria has long caused tension with Turkey, which views them as a wing of the outlawed PKK, which is considered a “terrorist” group by Turkey, the US and the European Union. On Wednesday, Turkey said the two attackers had come from Syria. The bombing killed both attackers and wounded two police officers. The SDF denied that the bombers had passed through its territory. Late on Thursday, the Turkish defence ministry said that it had destroyed 30 targets in northern Syria, including an oil well, a storage facility and shelters, and it “neutralised” a number of fighters.

"What’s fen­tanyl, and why have deaths due to drug over­dose spiked in the US?",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/5/whats-fentanyl-and-why-have-deaths-due-to-drug-overdose-spiked-in-the-us,"In 2021, two-thirds of drug-re­lat­ed over­dose deaths in the US were linked to syn­thet­ic opi­oids like fen­tanyl.","The United States is imposing sanctions and launching indictments against dozens of Chinese companies and individuals it claims are involved in the illegal trade of thehighly addictive drugfentanyl. The charges, brought by the US Attorney’s Office in Florida, and sanctions by the Department of Treasury on Tuesday, have been strongly condemned by China. “We know that this global fentanyl supply chain, which ends with the deaths of Americans, often starts with chemical companies in China,” USAttorney General Merrick Garland toldreporters. In this visual explainer, Al Jazeera breaks down the numbers behind fentanyl overdoses in the US. Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid, often used in the medical field as a pain management medication for cancer patients. However, as little as 2 milligrams of fentanyl can be lethal. It is estimated to be 100 times more potent than morphine and almost 50 times more potent than heroin. Although fentanyl is approved for medical use, especially in pain management, more than 150 people in the US die every day from overdoses related to synthetic opioids like fentanyl. There are two forms of fentanyl: the pharmaceutical version, prescribed by doctors and used in hospitals and pain treatment centres worldwide for pain management, and illegally manufactured fentanyl. While both are synthetic opioids, it is primarily the illegally manufactured fentanyl that contributes to the majority of overdose deaths. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), overdose deaths from illegal synthetic opioids were 23 times higher in 2021 compared with 2013. Illegally manufactured fentanyl can look like any other powdered drug, and it is often mistaken for other illicit drugs, like heroin, cocaine and methamphetamines. With its low-cost production and high potency, drug dealers often mix fentanyl with other drugs to boost the addictive nature of the high. More than 106,000 people died of a drug overdose in 2021, with two-thirds (67 percent) of those deaths involving synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Due to fentanyl’s high potency, low-cost manufacturing, ease of smuggling, and asymmetric tolerance between new and old users, it can have disastrous effects, especially on new users. Longtime drug users tend to build a tolerance, requiring higher dosages to get the same high. However, when new users unknowingly take fentanyl-laced pills, they often end up in lethal overdose. Although there are many contributing factors that can lead to a lethal overdose, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) 2mg of fentanyl is considered a lethal dose. To put this in perspective, a lethal dose of fentanyl is smaller than the tip of a pencil.  Fentanyl is the most potent opioid pain reliever available for use in medical treatment. It is roughly 100 times more potent than morphine, the most commonly used prescription medication for severe pain. Similar to other opioid drugs, fentanyl works by binding to the body’s opioid receptors, affecting the brain’s control of pain and emotion. After repeated opioid use, the brain undergoes adaptations to the substance, reducing its responsiveness and making it difficult to experience pleasure outside of the opioid. Some of the side effects of fentanyl use are extreme happiness. It can cause mental confusion, memory issues, drowsiness, nausea, confusion and unconsciousness. Fentanyl also affects the respiratory system leading to breathing difficulties and chest wall tightening. It is also known to cause an irregular heartbeat and lead to constipation and decreased bowel mobility. The long-term effects put users at risk of heart attack or heart failure, immune system suppression, anxiety, depression, and other mood disorders. It can be attributed to the 4 Ps of fentanyl. The first P is for potency.As stated by the DEA and other drug control organisations, fentanyl is roughly 50 times more potent than heroin, making it highly addictive. The second P is production.Due to fentanyl’s cheap production costs, it’s an alluring commodity for would-be illegal drug manufacturers. Moreover, the raw ingredients to produce fentanyl are available on the open market. Unlike cocaine and heroin, the manufacturing process for fentanyl requires very little cultivation, making it easy to produce in small remote locations. The third P stands for profit.According to law enforcement officials in Canada, 1kg (2.2 pounds) of 8 percent pure fentanyl yields a profit of $640,000 to $1.6m. The last P depicts packaging.Because fentanyl is so concentrated, large amounts can be manufactured and smuggled in small packages. The low volume and hence the low cost of smuggling make it easy to distribute the drug in small trucks and vehicles. These factors make fentanyl a preferred choice for illegal drug dealers and make it difficult for law enforcement agencies to limit the exposure and lethality of the illegally manufactured fentanyl economy."

‘My son was afraid. He asked me for a kiss. It was the last I gave him’,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/5/syrian-family-longs-for-justice-ten-years-after-shipwreck,The 2013 Lampe­dusa tragedy known as the chil­dren’s ship­wreck shook the world’s con­science. Sur­vivors still want an­swers.,"Lampedusa, Italy –Every year, Refaat Hazima visits the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa, where tragedy struck his family 10 years ago. On October 10, 2013, Hazima and his wife Feryal el-Saleh paid $6,000 to board a blue wooden vessel in the Libyan city of Zuwara with their three sons and more than 400 passengers, mostly fellow Syrians fleeing the war-ravaged country. The boat left under the cover of darkness at about 10pm and sailed at full speed, before coming under attack from Libyan armed men. “They opened fire against us,” Hazima told Al Jazeera. “A bullet hit a pregnant woman and killed her.” The vessel sailed on as water gushed into the hull through bullet holes. As it reached international waters on the morning of October 11, a Syrian doctor, who identified himself as Mohamed Jammo, placed the first distress call to the Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (IMRCC). It was 12:39pm. “The wooden boat is going down, please [help],” Jammo said in English, according to a transcript of the call. “We are going to die!” For hours, Hazima clung on to his wife and children – 16-year-old Anas, 12-year-old Ahmad and nine-year-old Mohammad – searching the horizon for a rescue vessel that could bring them to safety. None arrived. At 3:37pm, Jammo placed a sixth and final call to the IMRCC, informing Rome of the boat’s location some 32km (20 miles) off the coast of Lampedusa. “We are falling down, now, and we have about 100 children,” he said, as the boat sank. The vessel rocked with the waves as passengers were flung from side to side, screaming and grabbing the handrail and each other. “My youngest son Mohammad was afraid and told me, ‘Dad, give me a kiss’, and so I did,” Hazima said. “That kiss was the last one I gave him.” He took a deep breath as the boat rolled upside down and water came rushing in. The door to the deck slammed shut, blocking his escape route, and he pulled and pushed until it cracked open and he slid through. Among the voices rising above the water’s surface, Hazima recognised that of his eldest son, Anas, calling for him. “I swam to him and embraced him,” he said. Yet, his wife and younger children were nowhere to be seen. “I didn’t know what to do,” he said. “Should I leave Anas and risk him drowning to go look for the others?” Lifeless bodies floated among survivors frantically calling for their loved ones, and he struggled to think. Hazima eventually found his wife in a state of shock, but alive. “The only thing she would say was: ‘Where are the children?’” At 5:54pm, an Italian military aircraft dropped rubber buoys and a raft among the survivors. Hazima fetched one to cling on to until the Libra, an Italian military vessel, and the Maltese patrol vessel P61 reached the scene of the shipwreck shortly after 6pm. Hazima, his wife, and their eldest son were taken to Malta alongside 52 passengers. A total of 211 survivors and 34 bodies were pulled out of the water by Italian and Maltese authorities during a rescue operation that stretched into the night. It was one of the worst shipwrecks in the Mediterranean. Italian authorities estimated 268 people died, including 60 children. Italian media referred to the tragedy as the “children’s shipwreck”. Among them were Ahmad and Mohammad Hazima. Jammo, the Syrian doctor who had pleaded for rescue with Italian and Maltese authorities, also lost two children – a five-year-old and a nine-month-old. On Tuesday, Hazima joined amarch in Lampedusaas Italy marked a National Day of Remembrance to honour those who died in 2013, and the tens of thousands who have perished at sea since. The anniversary is held on October 3, the day when a separate shipwreck in 2013 killed 368 asylum seekers from the Horn of Africa and shook the hearts of European leaders. This year was especially sombre for those who had embarked on the same journey as Hazima. In December, an Italian court found the coastguard and the navy guilty of manslaughter and negligence for failing to promptly dispatch rescue assets in accordance with international law. It concluded that Leopoldo Manna and Luca Licciardi, at the time respectively the head of the coastguard’s operation centre and the commander of the navy’s operational room, culpably and repeatedly ignored rescue requests, days after the coffins of the victims of the October 3 shipwrecks were lined up in a hangar at Lampedusa’s airport. The defendants pleaded not guilty, claiming no Italian responsibility since the shipwreck occurred in the Maltese search and rescue area and that operations were initially coordinated by Maltese authorities. Prosecutors in Rome requested their acquittal saying the two officers had acted with “no malice”. But call transcripts examined by the court found Manna, the head of the coastguard’s operation centre, repeatedly deflected responsibility and asked the passengers to refer to Maltese authorities. “Call Malta directly very quickly and … they are … they are close, OK?” the officer told Jammo. “OK, please, go, go, go, OK, OK, away.” The court found the Italian coastguard informed Malta of the distress case but failed on multiple occasions to mention that the boat was in serious trouble as the water was flowing in. The ruling by the court of Rome confirmed an opinion issued in 2021 by the United Nations Human Rights Office, which found Italian authorities guilty of failing “to protect the right to life” of the refugees. “It is a complex case. The accident happened in the international waters within the Maltese search and rescue zone but the location was indeed closest to Italy and to one of its naval ships,” UN Human Rights Committee member Helene Tigroudja said in a statement. “Had the Italian authorities immediately directed [their] naval ship and coastguard boats after the distress calls, the rescue would have reached the vessel at the latest two hours before it sank.” Although they were found guilty, Manna and Licciardi were not convicted as the trial was brought beyond the limitations period. Arturo Salerni, a lawyer representing Hazima and other survivors, told Al Jazeera the court proceedings had been a complex and lengthy attempt at bringing two governmental bodies as civil defenders before a court of law. The trial eventually began in July 2019 after multiple delays. “The Public Prosecutor’s Office perpetuated the idea that there was no Italian responsibility since the shipwreck occurred in the Maltese SAR [search and rescue] area and we had to oppose several requests for dismissal,” Salerni said. The global COVID-19 pandemic brought further delays, pushing the ruling beyond the legal timeframe. It must now be examined whether the Italian state is obliged to pay compensation to the victims in a civil law procedure. Salerni said he felt “bitterness” at the failure to reach a criminal conviction, which would have “carried a different weight at a time when shipwrecks continue to occur at sea”. But the 87-page sentence traced a detailed timeline of the shipwreck and established liability for the blame-shifting between Italy and Malta. “The sentence constitutes a legal precedent and a reminder of the obligation to unconditionally rescue lives at sea,” Salerni added. For Hazima, the prospect of a civil lawsuit feels like a punch in the face. “If someone kills a person, especially a child, they will be sent to jail,” he said. “Why wasn’t it so in this case?” The political climate in Italy has shifted since the double tragedy in 2013 prompted the left-wing government of then Prime Minister Enrico Letta to launch Mare Nostrum, a state-led operation that saved more than 150,000 lives in the Mediterranean Sea. The life-saving naval mission was suspended in 2014 after repeated refusals by the European Union to contribute to its operational costs of about 9 million euros ($9.5m at the current exchange rate) per month and was replaced by Frontex, the EU’s border security agency, which runs the bloc’s Joint Operation Triton on a budget of 2.9 million euros ($3.05m) per month with no search and rescue mandate. Over the course of the past decade, the responsibility for saving lives has fallen on nongovernmental organisations as the bloc’s anti-migration policies broadened and hardened. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni rose to power last year on a promise to curb irregular migration, forming the nation’s most right-wing government since 1945. Since coming to power, Meloni has banned NGO vessels from performing more than one rescue on a given trip, requiring them to disembark immediately – often at far-flung ports that require additional days of navigation – andimpounding shipsthat defy the rules. The leader of Fratelli d’Italia (FdI), a national conservative party with roots in the neo-fascist Movimento Sociale Italiano (Italian Social Movement), told a meeting of southern EU states in Malta on Friday that the bloc needed a “concrete, structured and definitive way forward” to respond to migration or “everyone will be overwhelmed”. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani defended the government’s actions during a visit to Berlin. “Nobody is waging a war against NGOs, we only say that they cannot … act as a sort of magnet to attract irregular migrants,” he said. NGOs operating at sea reject the accusation. According to Italy’s Ministry of the Interior, vessels operated by NGOs brought to shore 5,700 asylum seekers this year, about 4 percent of the total number of arrivals at sea (133,000). Monica Minardi, head of Doctors Without Borders (also known by its French initials MSF) in Italy, is concerned by Rome’s ongoing stigmatisation of NGOs as “sea taxies” and punitive decrees that limit their ability to operate life-saving missions. “The number of people rescued by NGOs is a minority compared to those who are saved by the coastguard,” Minardi said during a roundtable in Lampedusa on October 1. “But there is fear – a fear of the narration around migration that we are presenting.” The European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE), a European network of 105 NGOs, in May, blamed Malta and Italy for their nonresponse tactics to distress alerts in their search-and-rescue zones. According to the Asylum Information Database (AIDA), which is managed by ECRE, Malta’s alleged lack of action resulted in the failure to rescue 7,459 people in distress in 2022. Anger has flared among some Italians over the failure to prevent shipwrecks a short distance from shore. In February, avessel capsizedabout 74km (46 miles) off the coast of Cutro in the southern Calabria region, after being spotted by a plane operated by Frontex. Italian authorities said the patrol boats sent to intercept it returned to port due to bad weather, resulting in delayed rescue operations. At least 94 victims, including 35 children, died in the shipwreck, the first tragedy so close to the shore in Italy since the October 3 disaster off Lampedusa. The shipwreck, which occurred as MSF’s Geo Barents became the first NGO vessel to be handed a fine and a 20-day halt under Meloni’s decrees, reignited the debate on immigration in Europe and Italy. For Minardi, migration management policies can be discussed at length, but saving lives is non-negotiable. “There is an obligation to save lives,” Minardi said. “We must remember that no life is worth more than another.” "
Who could re­place Kevin Mc­Carthy as the next US House speak­er?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/5/who-could-replace-mccarthy-as-the-next-us-house-speaker,Steve Scalise and Jim Jor­dan from the Re­pub­li­can Par­ty have de­clared their can­di­da­cy for the role.,"The United States House of Representatives has removed its speaker for the first time in the body’s 234-year history, and Republicans are already raising their hands to take over the role. Republican Representative Kevin McCarthy was expelled from his role in a 216-210 vote on Tuesday evening. Here is what we know about potential candidates who could succeed McCarthy as House speaker. Immediately after McCarthy was unseated, Republican Representative Patrick McHenry was appointed acting speaker. McHenry, a McCarthy ally, will serve as acting speaker for three legislative days. Until a new speaker is elected, McHenry’s role is to exercise the necessary and appropriate authority of the speaker. Republican Representative Kelly ArmstrongsaidMcHenry’s main task will be to “get us a new speaker”. Anything further, he said, would lead to his removal from the role. Next week, the Republicans and Democrats will informally nominate a candidate from each party and then the entire House will vote for the next speaker. Representatives are not required to vote for the candidate their party nominated, but to become the speaker, a candidate must win the majority vote from House members who are present and voting. The elected speaker will hold the position until early January 2025 unless they too are deposed. Republicans Troy Nehls and Greg Steube have advocated for making Trump the next House speaker. Under the US Constitution, the House speaker does not have to be a member of Congress. However, Trump may not be eligible since he is under four criminal indictments. House Republican rules state that a member of leadership must step aside if indicted. Trump has said his focus is on the 2024 presidential election. McCarthy was expelled from his role after far-right Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz launched an effort to remove him. McCarthywas removedas a result of infighting within the Republican Party as hardliners were critical of McCarthy for collaborating with Democrats to get a stopgap bill passed. McCarthy can run for speaker again. But he announced on Tuesday night that he will not try to win back the gavel."
