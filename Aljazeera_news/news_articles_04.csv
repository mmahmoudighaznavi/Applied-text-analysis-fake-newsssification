Democrats sided with right-wing Republicans on Tuesday tovote outthe Republican’s Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House, an unprecedent move in US political history which comes amid a bitter divide inside the Republican party. Here is a look at what comes next:     "
More than 20 killed af­ter Ital­ian tourist bus crash­es off Venice over­pass,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/4/more-than-20-killed-after-italian-tourist-bus-crashes-off-venice-overpass,"Bus car­ry­ing some 40 pas­sen­gers veered off el­e­vat­ed over­pass, plunged about 15 me­tres and caught fire, of­fi­cials re­port.","More than 20 people have been killed and 18 injured after a bus carrying foreign tourists crashed off an elevated overpass, plunged some 15 metres (50 feet) and caught fire near Venice in northern Italy, officials said. The bus veered off the road on Tuesday evening at approximately 19:45pm local time (17:45 GMT), crashed through a barrier, plummeted onto electricity lines and caught fire, according to reports. “An apocalyptic scene, there are no words,” Venice’s Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said in a post on social media. Official mourning has been declared in Venice in memory of the victims, the mayor said.  [Unofficial translation:A huge tragedy struck our community this evening. I immediately ordered the city to mourn, in memory of the numerous victims who were on the fallen bus. An apocalyptic scene, there are no words.] What caused the horrific accident was unclear. Venice City Councillor Renato Boraso said the bus had been carrying 40 passengers,  21 of whom had died and 18 were injured. Boraso warned that the death toll could rise as several of those hurt in the crash were in critical condition in hospital. “It’s an appalling tragedy, the city is in mourning,” Boraso told Sky Italia television. Five of the victims were Ukrainians and one was German, said Venice’s prefect Michele Di Bari, the local representative of the interior ministry. The bus was also carrying passengers from France and Croatia, Italian news agency ANSA reported. “The bus is totally crushed. The firefighters had difficulty getting a lot of the bodies out,” Di Bari told Sky Italia television. He said two children were among the victims. Late on Tuesday evening, rescuers were still struggling to remove the wreckage of the bus to make sure no more passengers were trapped inside. The Veneto region governor, Luca Zaia, told RAI state television that the cause of the accident was still unclear. “This is an important tragedy, but it’s difficult to understand how it happened,” Zaia said. “The bus was new and electric, and that street wasn’t particularly problematic.” Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed her condolences, saying in a statement that her government’s thoughts were with “the victims, their families and their friends”. Italy has suffered a number of deadly bus crashes in recent years. In 2017, 16 people on board a bus carrying Hungarian students died in an accident near the northern city of Verona, while 40 people died in 2013 when a bus plunged off a viaduct in southern Italy."
US House Speak­er Mc­Carthy re­moved from role in un­prece­dent­ed vote,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/3/us-house-speaker-mccarthy-removed-from-role-in-unprecedented-vote,The Re­pub­li­can House Speak­er failed to face down a chal­lenge from a small fac­tion of right-wing con­ser­v­a­tives.,"The United States House of Representatives has voted to remove Republican House SpeakerKevin McCarthyfrom his position, the result of infighting within his own party and persistent challenges from its rightward flank. McCarthy was expelled from his role in a 216-210 vote on Tuesday evening, the first time in US history that the House has voted to remove its leader. “Speaker McCarthy has failed to take a stand where it matters,” far-right Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, who launched the effort to remove McCarthy, said in a social media post before the vote. “So if he won’t, I will.” The unprecedented vote underscores growing turmoil in the Republican Party, also known as the GOP, with its hard-right faction sparring with McCarthy on several occasions since hefirst becamethe speaker in January. There is no clear choice within the party to replace him.  In the vote on Tuesday evening, eight Republicans broke with the speaker, sinking his chances of securing the majority needed to keep his job. Democrats, who have expressed frustration with McCarthy over what they see as his efforts to appeal to the Republican’s hard right, refused to vote in his favour. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has said that President Joe Biden hopes the House will quickly select a new speaker, saying the “urgent challenges facing our nation will not wait”. Jean-Pierre added “the American people deserve leadership that puts the issues affecting their lives front and center”. “Once the House has met their responsibility to elect a speaker, (Biden) looks forward to working together with them and with the senate to address the American peoples’ priorities,” Jean-Pierre said. Without a speaker, the House of Representatives is unable to push through bills, including vital spending bills. McCarthy has announced that he will not run for speaker again. Relations between McCarthy and his caucus have been rocky from the start. He only secured the speakership after 15 rounds of voting in the House, due to the opposition of a handful of right-wing legislators. Those tensions came to a head amid efforts to avoid a government shutdown over the weekend. McCarthy and Democratic lawmakers reached a deal that provided short-term funding for the government and avoided a shutdown, following a failed effort by Republicans to push through a bill that would have imposed dramatic cuts of as much as 30 percent on a number of social programmes.  On Monday evening, Gaetzlaunched an effortto remove McCarthy from his role as speaker, alleging that he had betrayed the party by working towards a compromise deal with Democrats to avoid a shutdown. McCarthy took to social media with a defiant message: “Bring it on”. Less than 24 hours later, he became the first House Speaker in US history to be removed from the role in a Congressional vote."
Biden thanks Qatar’s emir for rare Iran-US pris­on­er swap deal,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/3/biden-thanks-qatars-emir-for-rare-iran-us-prisoner-swap-deal,Doha-me­di­at­ed deal saw Iran free five Amer­i­cans in ex­change for five Ira­ni­ans held in the US and trans­fer of $6bn.,"Qatar’s Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani has received a phone call from United States President Joe Biden who has thanked the Gulf nation’s emir for his help in mediating a landmark prisoner swap deal with Iran. The emir’s office said in a statement on Tuesday that Biden spoke positively of Doha’s “active and constructive” efforts in global politics. “During the call, the strategic relations between the two countries and aspects of supporting and strengthening them in various fields were reviewed,” the Amiri Diwan, or the emir’s office, said in the statement. The phone call came days after Iran and the USexchanged five prisonersheld in their respective countries, part of a deal that also included the unfreezing of $6bn in Iranian funds.  The deal was reached amid tensionsbetween the US and Iranafter Washington unilaterally withdrew from a nuclear agreement in 2018. Five US citizens previously detained by Iran were flown to the Qatari capital of Doha on September 18. The US also released five Iranian prisoners. Biden later said theswap dealhad brought an end to “years of agony, uncertainty, and suffering” for those detained. However, relations between Washington and Tehran remain highly strained, with few signs of improving anytime soon, even as Iran and US ally Saudi Arabia takecautious stepstowards easing tensions after years of competing for influence throughout the region. Several rounds of indirect negotiations have failed to revive the formernuclear accord, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in which Iran accepted curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for relief from US sanctions. Other events, such as Iran’sharsh crackdownon protesters, the alleged sale of drones to Russia in support of its war in Ukraine and the seizure ofoil tankersin the Strait of Hormuz, have also contributed to deteriorating relations. The prisoner swap was alsopolitically contentiousin the US, with more hawkish lawmakers in Congress slamming it as a concession to Iran. The Biden administration defended the agreement, saying it allowed what the US maintained were people wrongfully detained in Iran to return home. "
Turkey launch­es new strikes on PKK tar­gets in north­ern Iraq,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/3/turkey-launches-new-strikes-on-pkk-targets-in-northern-iraq,Turk­ish war­planes strike Kur­dish sites for a sec­ond time in three days af­ter a sui­cide at­tack in Ankara.,"Turkish forces have conducted new air strikes in northern Iraq and destroyed 16 targets of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), its Ministry of National Defence says. The operations were conducted in the Metina, Gara, Hakurk, Qandil and Asos regions at 8pm (17:00 GMT) on Tuesday, the ministry said, adding that every measure was taken to avoid harm to civilians and the environment. Two attackersdetonated a bombin front of Turkish government buildings in Ankara on Sunday, leaving both of them dead and two police officers wounded.  The PKK claimed responsibility for the attack, prompting Turkish strikes on the group’s targets in northern Iraq later on Sunday. The PKK, listed as a“terrorist group”by Turkey and its Western allies, has been waging attacks since 1984, killing tens of thousands of people. A series of successive Turkish military operations has pushed the group back into neighbouring Iraq.  ThePKK attackon Sunday coincided with the opening of Turkey’s parliament session, during which lawmakers will be asked to ratify Sweden’s membership in the NATO military alliance. Turkey’s ratification has been held up by its anger over the refusal by the Swedish police to ban marches by the PKK and their supporters in Stockholm. Some analysts believe the PKK may be trying to block the ratification because it would herald an improvement in Turkey’s tense ties with the United States. Turkey is also trying to get the US to drop its support for Kurdish fighters from the YPG group in Syria, a policy shift Ankara may expect in return for its ratification. Washington relied on the YPG to fight the ISIL (ISIS) group in the region. But Ankara views the YPG as a sister organisation of the PKK."
Can plant­i­ng trees re­al­ly help fight cli­mate change?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/3/can-planting-trees-really-help-fight-climate-change,"Plant­i­ng trees has been pro­mot­ed as a method for ad­dress­ing glob­al warm­ing, but could it do more harm than good?","Bill Gates is emphatic. “I don’t plant trees,” he declared recently, wading into a debate about whether mass tree planting is really much use in fighting climate change. The billionaire philanthropist was being probed on how he offsets hiscarbon emissionsand insisted he avoids “some of the less proven approaches”. The claim that planting enough trees could solve theclimate crisisis “complete nonsense”, he told a climate discussion organised by The New York Times last week. “Are we the science people or are we the idiots?” Gates’s polemical pronouncements made headlines and prompted criticism from backers ofreforestation(planting trees in damaged forests) and afforestation (planting in areas that were not recently forest). “I have dedicated the last 16 years of my life to making forests part of the climate solution,” wrote Jad Daley, head of the American Forests NGO. “This kind of commentary can really set us back,” he said on X, formerly known as Twitter. Mass tree planting schemes have been gaining ground for years as a way to suck carbon from the atmosphere at scale. Even notoriously climate change-scepticalUS Republicanshave introduced legislation to support planting a trillion trees worldwide.  But Gates is far from alone in doubting the benefits of such ambitious plans. A group of scientists warned on Tuesday thatmass tree plantingrisks doing more harm than good, particularly in tropical regions. That’s primarily because it can replace complex ecosystems with monoculture plantations. “Society has reduced the value of these ecosystems to just one metric – carbon,” the scientists from universities in Britain and South Africa wrote. Carbon capture is “a small component of the pivotal ecological functions that tropical forests and grassy ecosystems perform,” they said in an article in the Trends in Ecology and Evolution journal. Jesus Aguirre Gutierrez, an author of the paper, pointed to examples in southern Mexico and Ghana, where once diverse forests “have now transformed into homogenous masses”. This makes them “highly vulnerable to diseases and negatively impacts local biodiversity,” the senior researcher at the University of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute told AFP news agency. Major tree planting commitments often involve agroforestry or plantations, where the trees will eventually be felled, releasing carbon. And they are dominated by five tree species chosen largely for their timber and pulp value, or growth speed. Among them is teak, which can overtake native species, “posing additional risks to native vegetation and the ecosystem”, said Aguirre Gutierrez, who is also a Natural Environment Research Council fellow. Other critiques include the lack of space globally for the many proposed mass planting projects and the risk of competition between smallholder agriculture and planting. Misclassification of grassland and wetland as suitable for forest and planting poorly adapted or cared-for seedlings have also been problems highlighted by scientists. So does planting trees really have no value? Not so fast, says Daley, whose American Forests organisation says it has planted 65 million trees. It’s Gates’s premise that is wrong, Daley said. “Literally no one is saying … that forests alone can save our environment,” he told AFP. He argues that critics ignore carefully calibrated projects involving native species in areas that need reforestation and focus instead on a few poorly conceived schemes.  “This broad brush critique has ignored the fact that much reforestation is driven by the loss of forests that won’t regenerate without help.” “We are not just running around planting trees wherever we feel like it to capture carbon.” There are efforts to bridge the gap between critics and proponents, including 10 “golden rules for restoring forests”, proposed by Britain’s Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and Botanic Gardens Conservation International. They advise avoiding grasslands orwetlands, prioritising natural regeneration, and selecting resilient and biodiverse trees. But they start with a rule that perhaps everyone can agree upon:protect existing forestsfirst. “It can take over 100 years for these forests to recover, so it is crucial that we protect what we already have before planting more.”"
Pak­istan wants un­doc­u­ment­ed mi­grants to leave by No­vem­ber 1 or get de­port­ed,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/3/pakistan-wants-undocumented-migrants-to-leave-by-november-1-or-get-deported,Gov­ern­ment’s planned crack­down makes the fu­ture of an es­ti­mat­ed 1.7 mil­lion Afghans in Pak­istan un­cer­tain.,"Pakistan has ordered all undocumented immigrants, mainly nearly 1.73 million Afghan nationals, to voluntarily leave the country or face deportations. “We have given them a November 1 deadline,” Interior Minister Sarfraz Bugti said on Tuesday amid claims by Islamabad that 14 of 24 suicide bombings in the country this year were carried out by Afghan nationals. Bugti said an estimated 1.73 million Afghan nationals in Pakistan have no legal documents to stay, adding that a total of 4.4 million Afghan refugees live in Pakistan. “There are no two opinions that we are attacked from within Afghanistan and Afghan nationals are involved in attacks on us,” he said. “We have evidence.” Islamabad has received the largest influx of Afghan refugees since the Soviet invasion of their country in 1979. About 1.3 million Afghans are registered refugees in Pakistan and 880,000 more have legal status to remain, according to the latest United Nations figures. “If they do not go, … then all the law enforcement agencies in the provinces or federal government will be utilised to deport them,” Bugti said. It was not immediately clear how Pakistani authorities could ensure the undocumented immigrants leave or how they could find them to expel them. Pakistan’s announcement, called “harassment” by the Afghan embassy in Islamabad, marked a new low in its relations with Kabul, which have deteriorated sinceborder clashesbetween the South Asian neighbours last month.  In a statement on X, the embassy said more than 1,000 Afghans have been detained in the past two weeks – half of them despite having a legal right to be in Pakistan. “Despite the repeated promises of the Pakistan authorities, the arrest and harassment of Afghan refugees by the police in Pakistan continues,” it said. Fazal Rehman, a 57-year-old Afghan fruit seller in the northwestern city of Peshawar, said he arrived in Pakistan 30 years ago and his children have never been to Afghanistan. He said he had never felt the need to register with Pakistani authorities and now fears it is too late to do so. “We request the Pakistan government not to expel us in such a hasty way and allow us either to live here peacefully, or we should be given at least six months to one year time to go back,” he said.  Bugti said from November 1, Pakistan would allow entry only to Afghans with valid passports and visas. For years, Afghans entering Pakistan throughland borderswere allowed to use their national identity cards as a travel document. There is a huge waiting list in Afghanistan for nationals seeking to get passports, and obtaining a Pakistan visa can take months. Bugti also warned of a crackdown on property and businesses owned by the Afghans in Pakistan. "
Twelve in­fants among 24 dead in a day at hos­pi­tal in In­dia’s Ma­ha­rash­tra,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/3/twelve-infants-among-24-dead-in-a-day-at-hospital-in-indias-maharashtra,"Deaths spark po­lit­i­cal storm, with the op­po­si­tion ac­cus­ing the state gov­ern­ment and hos­pi­tal au­thor­i­ties of neg­li­gence.","Twelve infants have died in one day at a hospital in the Indian state of Maharashtra, sparking a political storm, with the opposition politicians accusing the regional government and hospital authorities of negligence. The infants died on Sunday and were among 24 deaths recorded that day at the Shankarrao Chavan Government Hospital in Nanded district, some 600km (373 miles) from India’s financial capital Mumbai, hospital officials and local media said on Tuesday. “My brother’s one-day-old infant died on Sunday at the hospital, and he was the fifth baby to die. We saw four more babies die in front of us,” said Yogesh Solanki, whose family brought the baby to the hospital. Solanki said the neo-natal unit of the hospital, where the infants were being treated, was very crowded on Sunday, with four to five babies in one incubator, which was otherwise designed to hold just one. The dean of Shankarrao Chavan Hospital, Shyamrao Wakode, did not respond to a Reuters news agency’s request for comment on this allegation or opposition accusations of negligence, saying in a brief phone call that he had no time because a government minister was visiting the premises. Earlier on Tuesday, Wakode said the 12 adult patients died of various ailments including diabetes, liver failure and kidney failure. “There was no shortage of medicines or doctors. Proper care was provided to the patients, but their bodies did not respond to the treatment, which caused deaths,” Wakode was quoted as saying by Indian media reports. The Maharashtra government said on Tuesday it had launched an inquiry into the deaths of the infants and other patients on Sunday. “Twenty-four is a big number. Why did so many deaths occur in one day? We will investigate if it was because of lack of medicines, or a shortage of staff or some other reason,” state minister Girish Mahajan told reporters. Opposition politicians accused the Maharashtra government, run by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party and an ally, of gross negligence over the deaths of the infants. “The BJP government spends thousands of scores of rupees on its publicity but there is no money for medicines for children?” Rahul Gandhi, leader of the main opposition Congress party, said in a post on social media platform X. In Shankarrao Chavan Hospital on Tuesday, patients crowded the corridors and pigs roamed the grounds outside, underlining the disarray at most government-run hospitals in the world’s most populous country. India’s public healthcare system is woefully ill-equipped, plagued by a dearth of staff and equipment. The doctor-to-patient ratio is 0.7 per 1,000, according to the World Health Organization, which recommends a level of 1 per 1,000. Sunday’s deaths were the second such episode in Maharashtra in as many months. In August, 18 people admitted to a state-run hospital in the Thane region died during a 24-hour period, local media reported. The state government ordered an investigation into the incident at the time."
At least 18 killed in blast at il­le­gal oil re­fin­ery in Nige­ria: Re­port,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/3/several-killed-in-blast-at-illegal-oil-refinery-in-nigeria-report,"The blaze oc­curred when a home-made re­fin­ery ig­nit­ed a near­by oil reser­voir, leav­ing vic­tims se­vere­ly burned.","At least 18 people, including a pregnant woman, have died in southern Nigeria when an illegal oil refinery exploded into flames, a security official and residents said. The blaze took place early on Monday in Rivers State’s Emohua district when a homemade refinery ignited a nearby oil reservoir, leaving victims severely burned, according to a report by AFP news agency on Tuesday. “The fire outbreak started at a very late hour … 18 victims were burnt beyond recognition while 25 injured persons were rescued,” said Olufemi Ayodele, spokesman for the local Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps. “Most of the victims were youths … a pregnant woman and a young lady getting ready for her marriage ceremony next month were all casualties,” he said. In another report, the Reuters news agency, citing a local Ibaa community leader, said as many as 37 people died in the blaze. “Thirty-five people were caught in the fire. Two people who were lucky to escape also died this morning [Tuesday] in hospital,” Rufus Welekem, the head of security in the community, told Reuters. Illegal refining is common in the oil-rich Niger Delta region of Nigeria as impoverished locals tap pipelines to make fuel to sell for a profit. The practice, which can be as basic as boiling crude oil in drums to extract fuel, is often deadly. Nigeria – an OPEC member and one of Africa’s largest petroleum producers – has for years tried to clamp down on illegal crude refineries, with little success, in part because powerfully connected politicians and security officials are involved, local environmental groups say. Crude oil theft, pipeline vandalism and legal battles over oil spills are pushing oil majors operating in Nigeria to sell their onshore and shallow water assets to concentrate on deepwater operations.

Joe Biden’s son Hunter pleads not guilty to fed­er­al firearms charges,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/3/joe-bidens-son-hunter-pleads-not-guilty-to-federal-firearms-charges,US pres­i­dent’s son has be­come a favourite sub­ject of crit­i­cism for Re­pub­li­can law­mak­ers and con­ser­v­a­tive me­dia fig­ures.,"US President Joe Biden’s sonHunterhas entered a not guilty plea to three firearms-related charges, moving the case closer to a potential trial ahead of the 2024 elections as his father seeks re-election. The 53-year-old appeared in court in the eastern state of Delaware on Tuesday to enter a plea to thefederal chargesafter a plea deal that would have avoided lengthy legal proceedings failed to move forward. US Magistrate Judge Christopher Burke has said the president’s son, whose legal issues and history of scandals are a favourite target of Republican lawmakers, should receive “no special treatment”.  The charges revolve around an allegation that Hunter Biden lied about his history of drug use on a form to buy a firearm in October 2018. Aplea dealthat would have swiftly concluded the criminal proceedings fell apart over the summer. The president’s son has become a lightning rod for criticism from Republican politicians and conservative media figures who have alleged, with little evidence, that the elder Biden sits at the centre of a vast network of corrupt business activities. Hunter Biden has not been charged with any crimes connected to hisforeign business activitiesand denies any wrongdoing. But the prospect of a trial during the period running up to the November 2024 elections is sure to galvanise such efforts by Republicans, who are currently mounting animpeachment inquiryinto the president. Hunter faces two counts of making false statements and one of illegal gun possession, crimes punishable by up to 25 years in prison.  Under the aborted plea deal, which typically requires an admission of guilt in exchange for more lenient sentencing, Hunter Biden would have pleaded guilty and served probation instead of jail time on misdemeanour tax charges and avoided prosecution on the gun charges if he avoided additional trouble with the law for a period of two years. The president’s son has never held public office and has long struggled with issues of drug addiction, including during the period in which he purchased the .38-caliber Colt Cobra revolver in 2018."
