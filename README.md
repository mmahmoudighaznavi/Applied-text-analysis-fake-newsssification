# Fake News Classification using Deep Learning and Classical Algorithms

--- 

## About <a name = "about"></a>

Fake news refers to misinformation or disinformation presented as news. It often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity or making money through advertising revenue. However, identifying the veracity of an article can be a complex task due to the quality of writing, inherent biases, or simply the nature of the information being reported.

In this project, we aim to tackle the problem of fake news detection using machine learning and deep learning approaches. We employ a diverse set of models including classical machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting and advanced Deep Learning techniques such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU).

## Dataset

- [ ] The first dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, which includes different features like 'author', 'title', and 'text'. The 'text' column contains the content of the news articles. The dataset comprises 20800 rows and 5 columns.
- [ ] The second data resource for this project is sourced from Aljazeera website. Web scraping and selenium used to get fresh news from Aljazeera website.

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning and Pre-processing

The first step in our analysis involved cleaning the data. We removed unnecessary columns and handled missing data points. To mitigate the effects of class imbalance, we ensured that there's an equal distribution of the two classes - 'fake' and 'true' news.

The 'fake' news is labeled as '1' with 10413 instances, and the 'true' news labeled as '0' with 10387 instances, which provides us a balanced dataset for our models.

### Text Pre-processing
Text data needs to be processed and tokenized before we can use it for machine learning algorithms. Here is a plain language explanation of the text processing steps we followed:

**Removing Non-Alpha Characters:** We first cleaned up the text by removing any characters that aren't alphabets. This includes numbers, punctuation, and special characters.

**Lowercasing:** Next, we converted all the text to lowercase. This is done to ensure that the same word, when used in different cases, is considered the same. For example, 'Fake' and 'fake' are the same words and should be treated as such.

**Removing Stop Words and Stemming:** English has many common words like 'is', 'an', 'the', etc., which do not add much value when it comes to understanding the meaning of the text. These are called stop words and we removed them. Next, we performed a process called 'stemming'. This is where words are reduced to their base or root form. For example, 'driving', 'drives', 'drove' are variations of the word 'drive'.
